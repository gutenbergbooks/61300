<h2 id="STOCKING">THE KID HANGS UP HIS STOCKING</h2></div>


<p>The clock in the West Side Boys' Lodging-house
ticked out the seconds of Christmas eve as
slowly and methodically as if six fat turkeys were
not sizzling in the basement kitchen against the
morrow's spread, and as if two-score boys were not
racking their brains to guess what kind of pies
would go with them. Out on the avenue the shop-keepers
were barring doors and windows, and shouting
"Merry Christmas!" to one another across the
street as they hurried to get home. The drays ran
over the pavement with muffled sounds; winter had
set in with a heavy snow-storm. In the big hall
the monotonous click of checkers on the board kept
step with the clock. The smothered exclamations
of the boys at some unexpected, bold stroke, and
the scratching of a little fellow's pencil on a slate,
trying to figure out how long it was yet till the big
dinner, were the only sounds that broke the quiet
of the room. The superintendent dozed behind
his desk.</p>

<p>A door at the end of the hall creaked, and a head
with a shock of weather-beaten hair was stuck
cautiously through the opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
"Tom!" it said in a stage-whisper. "Hi, Tom!
Come up an' git on ter de lay of de Kid."</p>

<p>A bigger boy in a jumper, who had been lounging
on two chairs by the group of checker players, sat
up and looked toward the door. Something in the
energetic toss of the head there aroused his instant
curiosity, and he started across the room. After a
brief whispered conference the door closed upon the
two, and silence fell once more on the hall.</p>

<p>They had been gone but a little while when they
came back in haste. The big boy shut the door
softly behind him and set his back against it.</p>

<p>"Fellers," he said, "what d'ye t'ink? I'm blamed
if de Kid ain't gone an' hung up his sock fer
Chris'mas!"</p>

<p>The checkers dropped, and the pencil ceased
scratching on the slate, in breathless suspense.</p>

<p>"Come up an' see," said Tom, briefly, and led
the way.</p>

<p>The whole band followed on tiptoe. At the foot
of the stairs their leader halted.</p>

<p>"Yer don't make no noise," he said, with a menacing
gesture. "You, Savoy!"&mdash;to one in a patched
shirt and with a mischievous twinkle,&mdash;"you don't
come none o' yer monkey-shines. If you scare de
Kid you'll get it in de neck, see!"</p>

<p>With this admonition they stole upstairs. In the
last cot of the double tier of bunks a boy much
smaller than the rest slept, snugly tucked in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
blankets. A tangled curl of yellow hair strayed
over his baby face. Hitched to the bedpost was a
poor, worn little stocking, arranged with much care
so that Santa Claus should have as little trouble
in filling it as possible. The edge of a hole in the
knee had been drawn together and tied with a string
to prevent anything falling out. The boys looked
on in amazed silence. Even Savoy was dumb.</p>

<p>Little Willie, or, as he was affectionately dubbed
by the boys, "the Kid," was a waif who had drifted
in among them some months before. Except that
his mother was in the hospital, nothing was known
about him, which was regular and according to the
rule of the house. Not as much was known about
most of its patrons; few of them knew more themselves,
or cared to remember. Santa Claus had
never been anything to them but a fake to make the
colored supplements sell. The revelation of the
Kid's simple faith struck them with a kind of awe.
They sneaked quietly downstairs.</p>

<p>"Fellers," said Tom, when they were all together
again in the big room,&mdash;by virtue of his length,
which had given him the nickname of "Stretch,"
he was the speaker on all important occasions,&mdash;"ye
seen it yerself. Santy Claus is a-comin' to this
here joint to-night. I wouldn't 'a' believed it. I
ain't never had no dealin's wid de ole guy. He
kinder forgot I was around, I guess. But de Kid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
says he is a-comin' to-night, an' what de Kid says
goes."</p>

<p>Then he looked round expectantly. Two of the
boys, "Gimpy" and Lem, were conferring aside in
an undertone. Presently Gimpy, who limped, as
his name indicated, spoke up.</p>

<p>"Lem says, says he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gimpy, you chump! you'll address de chairman,"
interrupted Tom, with severe dignity, "or
you'll get yer jaw broke, if yer leg <i>is</i> short, see!"</p>

<p>"Cut it out, Stretch," was Gimpy's irreverent
answer. "This here ain't no regular meetin', an'
we ain't goin' to have none o' yer rot. Lem, he
says, says he, let's break de bank an' fill de Kid's
sock. He won't know but it wuz ole Santy done it."</p>

<p>A yell of approval greeted the suggestion. The
chairman, bound to exercise the functions of office
in season and out of season, while they lasted,
thumped the table.</p>

<p>"It is regular motioned an' carried," he announced,
"that we break de bank fer de Kid's
Chris'mas. Come on, boys!"</p>

<p>The bank was run by the house, with the superintendent
as paying teller. He had to be consulted,
particularly as it was past banking hours; but the
affair having been succinctly put before him by a
committee, of which Lem and Gimpy and Stretch
were the talking members, he readily consented to
a reopening of business for a scrutiny of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
accounts which represented the boys' earnings at
selling papers and blacking boots, minus the cost
of their keep and of sundry surreptitious flings at
"craps" in secret corners. The inquiry developed
an available surplus of three dollars and fifty cents.
Savoy alone had no account; the run of craps had
recently gone heavily against him. But in consideration
of the season, the house voted a credit of
twenty-five cents to him. The announcement was
received with cheers. There was an immediate rush
for the store, which was delayed only a few minutes
by the necessity of Gimpy and Lem stopping on
the stairs to "thump" one another as the expression
of their entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>The procession that returned to the lodging-house
later on, after wearing out the patience of
several belated storekeepers, might have been the
very Santa's supply-train itself. It signalized its
advent by a variety of discordant noises, which
were smothered on the stairs by Stretch, with much
personal violence, lest they wake the Kid out of
season. With boots in hand and bated breath, the
midnight band stole up to the dormitory and looked
in. All was safe. The Kid was dreaming, and
smiled in his sleep. The report roused a passing
suspicion that he was faking, and Savarese was for
pinching his toe to find out. As this would inevitably
result in disclosure, Savarese and his proposal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
were scornfully sat upon. Gimpy supplied the
popular explanation.</p>

<p>"He's a-dreamin' that Santy Claus has come,"
he said, carefully working a base-ball bat past the
tender spot in the stocking.</p>

<p>"Hully Gee!" commented Shorty, balancing a
drum with care on the end of it, "I'm thinkin' he
ain't far out. Look's ef de hull shop'd come along."</p>

<p>It did when it was all in place. A trumpet and
a gun that had made vain and perilous efforts to
join the bat in the stocking leaned against the bed
in expectant attitudes. A picture-book with a pink
Bengal tiger and a green bear on the cover peeped
over the pillow, and the bedposts and rail were
festooned with candy and marbles in bags. An
express-wagon with a high seat was stabled in the
gangway. It carried a load of fir branches that left
no doubt from whose livery it hailed. The last
touch was supplied by Savoy in the shape of a
monkey on a yellow stick, that was not in the
official bill of lading.</p>

<p>"I swiped it fer de Kid," he said briefly in
explanation.</p>

<p>When it was all done the boys turned in, but not
to sleep. It was long past midnight before the deep
and regular breathing from the beds proclaimed
that the last had succumbed.</p>

<p>The early dawn was tinging the frosty window
panes with red when from the Kid's cot there came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a shriek that roused the house with a start of very
genuine surprise.</p>

<p>"Hello!" shouted Stretch, sitting up with a jerk
and rubbing his eyes. "Yes, sir! in a minute.
Hello, Kid, what to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Kid was standing barefooted in the passageway,
with a base-ball bat in one hand and a trumpet
and a pair of drumsticks in the other, viewing with
shining eyes the wagon and its cargo, the gun and
all the rest. From every cot necks were stretched,
and grinning faces watched the show. In the excess
of his joy the Kid let out a blast on the trumpet
that fairly shook the building. As if it were a
signal, the boys jumped out of bed and danced a
breakdown about him in their shirt-tails, even
Gimpy joining in.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!" said Stretch, looking down, "if
Santy Claus ain't been here an' forgot his hull kit,
I'm blamed!"</p>

<h2 id="CLAUS">IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?</h2></div>


<p class="smcap">"Dear Mr. Riis:</p>

<p class="i2">"A little chap of six on the Western frontier writes to us:</p>

<p class="i2">"'Will you please tell me if there is a Santa Claus? Papa says
not.'</p>

<p class="p2">"Won't you answer him?"</p>


<p class="p2">That was the message that came to me from an
editor last December just as I was going on a journey.
Why he sent it to me I don't know. Perhaps
it was because, when I was a little chap, my home
was way up toward that white north where even
the little boys ride in sleds behind reindeer, as they
are the only horses they have. Perhaps it was
because when I was a young lad I knew Hans
Christian Andersen, who surely ought to know, and
spoke his tongue. Perhaps it was both. I will ask
the editor when I see him. Meanwhile, here was
his letter, with Christmas right at the door, and, as
I said, I was going on a journey.</p>

<p>I buttoned it up in my greatcoat along with a
lot of other letters I didn't have time to read, and
I thought as I went to the depot what a pity it was
that my little friend's papa should have forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
about Santa Claus. We big people do forget the
strangest way, and then we haven't got a bit of a
good time any more.</p>

<p>No Santa Claus! If you had asked that car full
of people I would have liked to hear the answers
they would have given you. No Santa Claus!
Why, there was scarce a man in the lot who didn't
carry a bundle that looked as if it had just tumbled
out of his sleigh. I felt of one slyly, and it was a
boy's sled&mdash;a "flexible flyer," I know, because he
left one at our house the Christmas before; and I
distinctly heard the rattling of a pair of skates in
that box in the next seat. They were all good-natured,
every one, though the train was behind
time&mdash;that is a sure sign of Christmas. The brakeman
wore a piece of mistletoe in his cap and a broad
grin on his face, and he said "Merry Christmas" in
a way to make a man feel good all the rest of the
day. No Santa Claus, is there? You just ask him!</p>

<p>And then the train rolled into the city under the
big gray dome to which George Washington gave
his name, and by-and-by I went through a doorway
which all American boys would rather see than go
to school a whole week, though they love their
teacher dearly. It is true that last winter my own
little lad told the kind man whose house it is that
he would rather ride up and down in the elevator
at the hotel, but that was because he was so very
little at the time and didn't know things rightly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and, besides, it was his first experience with an
elevator.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I went through the door into
a beautiful white hall with lofty pillars, between
which there were regular banks of holly with the
red berries shining through, just as if it were out
in the woods! And from behind one of them there
came the merriest laugh you could ever think of.
Do you think, now, it was that letter in my pocket
that gave that guilty little throb against my heart
when I heard it, or what could it have been? I
hadn't even time to ask myself the question, for
there stood my host all framed in holly, and with
the heartiest handclasp.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said, and drew me after. "The
coffee is waiting." And he beamed upon the table
with the veriest Christmas face as he poured it out
himself, one cup for his dear wife and one for me.
The children&mdash;ah! you should have asked <i>them</i> if
there was a Santa Claus!</p>

<p>And so we sat and talked, and I told my kind
friends that my own dear old mother, whom I have
not seen for years, was very, very sick in far-away
Denmark and longing for her boy, and a mist came
into my hostess's gentle eyes and she said, "Let us
cable over and tell her how much we think of her,"
though she had never seen her. And it was no
sooner said than done. In came a man with a
writing-pad, and while we drank our coffee this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
message sped under the great stormy sea to the far-away
country where the day was shading into evening
already, though the sun was scarce two hours
high in Washington:</p>


<p class="smcap right p2">The White House.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Riis, Ribe, Denmark</i>:</p>

<p class="i2">Your son is breakfasting with us. We send you our love and sympathy.</p>

<p class="smcap right">Theodore and Edith Roosevelt.</p>


<p class="p2">For, you see, the house with the holly in the hall
was the White House, and my host was the President
of the United States. I have to tell it to you,
or you might easily fall into the same error I came
near falling into. I had to pinch myself to make
sure the President was not Santa Claus himself. I
felt that he had in that moment given me the very
greatest Christmas gift any man ever received: my
little mother's life. For really what ailed her was
that she was very old, and I know that when she got
the President's dispatch she must have become immediately
ten years younger and got right out of
bed. Don't you know mothers are that way when
any one makes much of their boys? I think Santa
Claus must have brought them all in the beginning&mdash;the
mothers, I mean.</p>

<p>I would just give anything to see what happened
in that old town that is full of blessed memories to
me, when the telegraph ticked off that message. I
will warrant the town hurried out, burgomaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
bishop, beadle and all, to do honor to my gentle
old mother. No Santa Claus, eh? What was that,
then, that spanned two oceans with a breath of love
and cheer, I should like to know. Tell me that!</p>

<p>After the coffee we sat together in the President's
office for a little while while he signed commissions,
each and every one of which was just Santa Claus's
gift to a grown-up boy who had been good in the
year that was going; and before we parted the
President had lifted with so many strokes of his
pen clouds of sorrow and want that weighed heavily
on homes I knew of to which Santa Claus had had
hard work finding his way that Christmas.</p>

<p>It seemed to me as I went out of the door, where
the big policeman touched his hat and wished me
a Merry Christmas, that the sun never shone so
brightly in May as it did then. I quite expected
to see the crocuses and the jonquils, that make the
White House garden so pretty, out in full bloom.
They were not, I suppose, only because they are
official flowers and have a proper respect for the
calendar that runs Congress and the Executive
Departments, too.</p>

<p>I stopped on the way down the avenue at Uncle
Sam's paymaster's to see what he thought of it.
And there he was, busy as could be, making ready
for the coming of Santa Claus. No need of my
asking any questions here. Men stood in line with
bank-notes in their hands asking for gold, new gold-pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
they said, most every one. The paymaster,
who had a sprig of Christmas green fixed in his desk
just like any other man, laughed and shook his head
and said "Santa Claus?" and the men in the line
laughed too and nodded and went away with their
gold.</p>

<p>One man who went out just ahead of me I saw
stoop over a poor woman on the corner and thrust
something into her hand, then walk hastily away.
It was I who caught the light in the woman's eye
and the blessing upon her poor wan lips, and the
grass seemed greener in the Treasury dooryard, and
the sky bluer than it had been before, even on that
bright day. Perhaps&mdash;well, never mind! if any
one says anything to you about principles and giving
alms, you tell him that Santa Claus takes care
of the principles at Christmas, and not to be afraid.
As for him, if you want to know, just ask the old
woman on the Treasury corner.</p>

<p>And so, walking down that Avenue of Good-will,
I came to my train again and went home. And
when I had time to think it all over I remembered
the letters in my pocket which I had not opened.
I took them out and read them, and among them
were two sent to me in trust for Santa Claus himself
which I had to lay away with the editor's message
until I got the dew rubbed off my spectacles. One
was from a great banker, and it contained a check
for a thousand dollars to help buy a home for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
poor children of the East Side tenements in New
York, where the chimneys are so small and mean
that scarce even a letter will go up through them,
so that ever so many little ones over there never
get on Santa Claus's books at all.</p>

<p>The other letter was from a lonely old widow,
almost as old as my dear mother in Denmark, and
it contained a two-dollar bill. For years, she wrote,
she had saved and saved, hoping some time to have
five dollars, and then she would go with me to the
homes of the very poor and be Santa Claus herself.
"And wherever you decided it was right to leave a
trifle, that should be the place where it would be
left," read the letter. But now she was so old that
she could no longer think of such a trip and so she
sent the money she had saved. And I thought of a
family in one of those tenements where father and
mother are both lying ill, with a boy, who ought to
be in school, fighting all alone to keep the wolf from
the door, and winning the fight. I guess he has been
too busy to send any message up the chimney, if
indeed there is one in his house; but you ask him,
right now, whether he thinks there is a Santa Claus
or not.</p>

<p>No Santa Claus? Yes, my little man, there is a
Santa Claus, thank God! Your father had just
forgotten. The world would indeed be poor without
one. It is true that he does not always wear a
white beard and drive a reindeer team&mdash;not always,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you know&mdash;but what does it matter? He is Santa
Claus with the big, loving, Christmas heart, for all
that; Santa Claus with the kind thoughts for every
one that make children and grown-up people beam
with happiness all day long. And shall I tell you
a secret which I did not learn at the post-office, but
it is true all the same&mdash;of how you can always be
sure your letters go to him straight by the chimney
route? It is this: send along with them a friendly
thought for the boy you don't like: for Jack who
punched you, or Jim who was mean to you. The
meaner he was the harder do you resolve to make
it up: not to bear him a grudge. That is the stamp
for the letter to Santa. Nobody can stop it, not
even a cross-draught in the chimney, when it has
that on.</p>

<p>Because&mdash;don't you know, Santa Claus is the
spirit of Christmas: and ever and ever so many
years ago when the dear little Baby was born after
whom we call Christmas, and was cradled in a
manger out in the stable because there was not room
in the inn, that Spirit came into the world to soften
the hearts of men and make them love one another.
Therefore, that is the mark of the Spirit to this day.
Don't let anybody or anything rub it out. Then
the rest doesn't matter. Let them tear Santa's white
beard off at the Sunday-school festival and growl
in his bearskin coat. These are only his disguises.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
The steps of the real Santa Claus you can trace all
through the world as you have done here with me,
and when you stand in the last of his tracks you
will find the Blessed Babe of Bethlehem smiling a
welcome to you. For then you will be home.</p>

<h2 id="SNOWSHED">THE CROGANS' CHRISTMAS IN THE SNOWSHED</h2></div>


<p>A storm was brewing in the mountains. The
white glare of the earlier day had been supplanted
by a dull gray, and the peaks that shut the winter
landscape in were "smoking," sure harbinger of a
blizzard already raging in the high Sierras. The
pines above the Crogans' cabin stood like spectral
sentinels in the failing light, their drooping
branches heavy with the snow of many storms.
Mrs. Tom Crogan sat at the window looking listlessly
into the darkening day.</p>

<p>In the spring she had come with her husband
from the little Minnesota town that was their home,
full of hope and the joy of life. The mountains
were beautiful then with wild flowers and the sweet
smell of fragrant firs, and as she rocked her baby
to sleep in their deep shadows she sang to him the
songs her mother had crooned over her cradle in her
tuneful Swedish tongue. Life then had seemed
very fair, and the snowshed hardly a shadow across
it. For to her life there were two sides: one that
looked out upon the mountains and the trees and the
wild things that stirred in God's beautiful world;
the other the blind side that turned toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
darkness man had made in his fight to conquer that
world. Tom Crogan was a dispatcher at a signal
station in the great snowsheds that stretched forty
miles or more up the slopes of the Sierras, plunging
the road to the Land of Sunshine into hour-long
gloom just when the jagged "saw-tooth" peaks, that
give the range its name, came into sight. Travelers
knew them to their grief: a huge crawling thing of
timber and stout planks&mdash;so it seemed as one caught
fleeting glimpses of it in the brief escapes from its
murky embrace&mdash;that followed the mountain up,
hugging its side close as it rose farther and farther
toward the summit. Hideous always, in winter
buried often out of sight by the smashing avalanches
Old Boreas hurled at the pigmy folk who
dared challenge him in his own realm; but within
the shelter of the snowsheds they laughed at his
bluster, secure from harm, for then it served its
appointed purpose.</p>

<p>The Crogans' house fronted or backed&mdash;whichever
way one chose to look at it&mdash;upon the shed.
Tom's office, where the telegraph ticker was always
talking of men and things in the desert sands to the
east, or in the orange groves over the Divide, never
saw the sunshine it told of. It burrowed in perpetual
gloom. Nine times a day trains full of
travelers, who peered curiously at the signalmen
with their lanterns and at Tom as so many human
moles burrowing in the mountain, came and went,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and took the world of men with them, yawning as
they departed at the prospect of more miles of
night. At odd intervals long freight trains lingered,
awaiting orders, and lent a more human touch. For
the engineer had time to swap yarns with Tom, and
the brakemen looked in to chuck the baby under the
chin and to predict, when their smudge faces frightened
him, that he would grow up to be as fine a
railroader as his father: his yell was as good as a
whistle to "down brakes." Even a wandering hobo
once in a while showed his face from behind the
truck on which he was stealing a ride 'cross country,
and grimaced at Mrs. Tom, safe in the belief that
she would not give him away. And she didn't.</p>

<p>But now the winter had come with the heavy
snows that seemed never to end. She could not
venture out upon the mountain where the pines
stood buried many feet deep. In truth there was
no getting out. Her life side was banked up, as it
were, to stay so till spring came again. As she sat
watching the great white waste that sloped upward
toward the lowering sky she counted the months:
two, three, four&mdash;five, probably, or six, to wait.
For this was Christmas, and the winter was but
fairly under way. Five months! The winters were
hard enough on the plains, but the loneliness of
these mountains! What glad visiting and holiday-making
were going on now in her old home among
kindred and friends! There it was truly a season of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
kindliness and good cheer; they had brought their
old Norse Yule with them across the seas. She
choked back a sob as she stirred the cradle with her
foot. For Tom's sake she would be brave. But
no letter nor word had come from the East, and
this their first Christmas away from home!</p>

<p>There was a man's step on the stairs from the
office, and Tom Crogan put his head through the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Got a bite for a hungry man?" he asked, blinking
a bit at the white light from without.</p>

<p>The baby woke up and gurgled. Tom waved the
towel at him, drying his face at the sink, and
hugged his wife as she passed.</p>

<p>"Storm coming," he said, glancing out at the
weather and listening to the soughing of the wind in
the pines.</p>

<p>"Nothing else here," she replied, setting the
table; "nothing this long while, and, oh, Tom!"&mdash;she
set down the plate and went over to him&mdash;"no
word from home, and this is Christmas Eve. Nothing
even for the baby."</p>

<p>He patted her back affectionately, and cheered
her after the manner of a man.</p>

<p>"Trains all late, the snow is that deep, more
particular in the East, they say. Mail might not
come through for a week. Baby don't know the
difference so long as he is warm. And coal we've
got a-plenty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
"Then it will be New Year's," she pursued her
own thoughts drearily. Tom was not a good comforter
just then.</p>

<p>He ate like a tired man, in silence. "Special on
the line," he said, as he stirred the sugar in his
coffee. "When the road opens up she'll follow right
on the Overland."</p>

<p>"Some o' your rich folks, most like, going for a
holiday on the Coast," she commented without interest.
Tom nodded. She gave the stove lid an
impatient twist.</p>

<p>"Little they know," she said bitterly, "or care
either, how we live up here in the sheds. They'd
oughter take their turn at it a while. There's the
Wrights with Jim laid up since he broke his leg
at the time o' the wreck, and can't seem to get no
strength. And the Coulsons with their old mother
in this grippin' cold, an' all the sickness they've
had, an' he laid off, though he wasn't to blame, an'
you know it, Tom. If it hadn't been for you what
would 'a' come to the Overland runnin' straight for
that wrecked freight with full head o' steam&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom looked up good-humoredly and pushed back
his plate.</p>

<p>"Why, Mary! what's come over you? I only
done what I was there to do&mdash;and they took notice
all right. Don't you remember the Company wrote
and thanked me for bein' spry?"</p>

<p>"Thanked you!" contemptuously. "What good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
is that? Here we be, an' like to stay till&mdash;&mdash;You
can come up if you want to."</p>

<p>The invitation was extended, ungraciously
enough, to a knot of men clustered about the steps.
They trooped in, a gang of snow-shovelers fresh
from their fight with the big drifts, and stood about
the stove, the cold breath of outdoors in their looks
and voices. Their talk was of their work just finished.
The road was clear, but for how long? And
they flapped their frozen mittens toward the window
through which the snow could be seen already
beginning to fall in large, ominous flakes. The
Special was discussed with eager interest. No one
knew who it was&mdash;an unusual thing. Generally
words came along the line giving the news, but
there had been no warning of this one.</p>

<p>"Mebbe it's the President inspectin'," ventured
one of the crew.</p>

<p>"I tank it bane some o' dem Wall Street fellers
on one big bust," threw in a husky Swede.</p>

<p>In the laugh that followed this sally the ticker
was heard faintly clicking out a message in the
office below.</p>

<p>Tom listened. "Overland three hours late," he
said, and added with a glance outside as he made
ready to go: "like as not they'll be later'n that; they
won't keep Christmas on the Coast this while."</p>

<p>The snow-shovelers trailed out after Tom with
many a fog-horn salute of Merry Christmas to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
wife and to the baby. The words, well meant,
jarred harshly upon Mrs. Crogan.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas! It sounded in her ear almost
like a taunt. When they were gone she stood at
the window, struggling with a sense of such bitter
desolation as she had never known till then. The
snow fell thick now, and was whirled across the
hillside in fitful gusts. In the gathering darkness
trees and rocks were losing shape and color; nothing
was left but the white cold, the thought of which
chilled her to the marrow. Through the blast the
howl of a lone wolf came over the ridge, and she
remembered the story of Donner Lake, just beyond,
and the party of immigrants who starved to death
in the forties, shut in by such a winter as this.
There were ugly tales on the mountain of things
done there, which men told under their breath when
the great storms thundered through the cañons and
all were safe within. She had heard the crew of the
rotary say that there was as much as ten feet of
snow on some of the levels already, and the winter
only well begun. Without knowing it she fell to
counting the months to spring again: two, three,
four, five! With a convulsive shudder she caught
up the child and fled to the darkest corner of the
room. Crouching there by the fire her grief and
bitterness found vent in a flood of rebellious tears.</p>

<p>Down in his dark coop Tom Crogan, listening to
a distant roar and the quickening rhythm of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
rails, knew that the Overland was coming. Presently
it shot out from behind the shoulder of the
mountain. Ordinarily it passed swiftly enough, but
to-day it slowed up and came to a stop at the station.
The conductor hurried into the office and held an
anxious consultation with Tom, who shook his head
decisively. If the storm kept up there would be no
getting out that night. The cut over at the lake
that had just been cleared was filling up again sure
with the wind blowing from the north. There was
nothing to do but wait, anyhow until they knew
for certain. The conductor agreed with bad grace,
and the rotary was started up the road to reconnoiter.
The train discharged its weary and worried
passengers, who walked up and down the dark
cavern to stretch their legs, glancing indifferently
at the little office where the telegraph kept up its
intermittent chatter.</p>

<p>Suddenly it clicked out a loud warning: "Special
on way. Clear the track."</p>

<p>Tom rapped on his window and gave quick
orders. The men hurried to carry them out.</p>

<p>"Not far she'll go," they grinned as they set the
switch and made all safe. At the turn half a mile
below the red eye of the locomotive gleamed already
in the dusk. In a few minutes it pulled in with a
shriek of its whistle that woke the echoes of the
hills far and near, and stood panting in a cloud of
steam. Trackmen and signalmen craned their necks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to see the mysterious stranger. Even Mrs. Tom had
dried her tears and came out to look at the despised
bigbugs from the East, rebellion yet in her homesick
heart.</p>

<p>The news that the "Big Boss" might be on board
had spread to the passenger train, and crowds
flocked from the sleepers, curious to get a glimpse
of the railroad magnate who had made such a stir
in the land. His power was so great that common
talk credited him with being stronger than Congress
and the courts combined. The newspapers recorded
all his doings as it did the President's, but with
this difference, that while everybody knew all about
the Man in the White House, few if any seemed
to know anything real about the railroad man's private
life. In the popular estimation he was a veritable
Sphinx. At his country home in the East he
had bought up the land for five miles around&mdash;even
the highways&mdash;to keep intruders out. Here
now was an unexpected chance, and the travelers
crowded up to get a look at him.</p>

<p>But they saw no luxurious private car with frock-coated
officials and liveried servants. An every-day
engine with three express cars in tow stood upon the
track, and baggagemen in blue overalls yelled for
hand-trucks, and hustled out boxes and crates consigned
to "The agent at Shawnee." Yet it was not
an every-day train nor an ordinary crew; for all
of them, conductor, brakemen, engineer and fireman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
wore holly in their caps and broad grins on
their faces. The locomotive flew two white flags
with the words "Merry Christmas" in red letters,
and across the cars a strip of canvas was strung their
whole length, with the legend "The Christmas
Train" in capitals a foot long. Even in the gloom
of the snowshed it shone out, plain to read.</p>

<p>Tom in his office rubbed his eyes for another and
better look when the conductor of the Special, pushing
his way through the wondering crowds, flung
open the door.</p>

<p>"Here's yer docyments," he said, slapping down a
paper, "and the orders are that ye're to see they
gets 'em."</p>

<p>Tom Crogan took up the paper as if dazed, and
looked at the entries without in the least understanding
what it all meant. He did not see the
jam of railroad men and passengers who had
crowded into the office on the heels of the conductor
until they filled it to the doors. Neither did
he notice that his wife had come with them and was
standing beside him looking as mystified as he.
Mechanically he read out the items in the way-bill,
while the conductor checked them off with many
a wink at the crowd. What nightmare was this?
Had some delirious Santa Claus invaded the office
of the Union Pacific Railroad, and turned it into
a toy shop and dry-goods bazar combined, with a
shake of his reindeer bells? Or was it a huge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
wretched, misbegotten joke? Surely stranger bill
of lading never went over the line, or over any
railroad line before. This was what he read:</p>


<p class="p2 i2">"Crate of fat turkeys, one for every family on the
station (their names followed).</p>

<p class="i2">"One ditto of red apples.</p>

<p class="i2">"One ditto of oranges, to be similarly apportioned.</p>

<p class="i2">"For Tom Crogan, one meerschaum pipe.</p>

<p class="i2">"For James Wright, lately injured in the service and
not yet recovered, a box of books, and allowance of full
pay during disability. Ordered to report at Sacramento
until fully restored.</p>

<p class="i2">"For John Coulson, Christmas gifts, including a warm
flannel wrapper for his old mother; also notice of back
pay allowed since suspension, with full restoration to place
and pay.</p>

<p class="i2">"For Mrs. Thomas Crogan, not on the official payroll,
but whom the Company takes this opportunity to thank
for assistance rendered her husband on a recent occasion,
one dress pattern, with the wishes of the Superintendent's
office for a very Merry Christmas.</p>

<p class="i2">"For Master Thomas Crogan, not yet on the official
payroll, being under age, a box of toys, including rubber
ball and sheep, doll and Noah's ark, with the compliments
of the Company for having chosen so able a railroad man
for his father.</p>

<p class="i2">"For Master Thomas Crogan, as a token of regard from
passengers on the Overland of November 18, one rocking-horse,
crated."</p>

<p class="p2">"Oh, Tom!"&mdash;Mrs. Crogan caught her breath
with a gasp&mdash;"and he not a year old!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Tom looked up to find the room full of people
laughing at him and at her, but there was hearty,
happy good-will in the laugh, and Mrs. Tom was
laughing back.</p>

<p>The conductor got up to go, but checked himself
abruptly. "If I didn't come near to forget," he said
and reached for his pocket. "Here, Tom, this is
for you from the Superintendent. If it ain't a secret
read it aloud."</p>

<p>The message was brief:</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Thomas Crogan, Esq.</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">Agent and Dispatcher at Shawnee Station:</p>

<p class="i2">The compliments of the season and of the Superintendent's
office to you. Have a Merry Christmas, Tom,
up in your shed, for we want you down on the Coast
after New Year's.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Frank Alden,</span><br />
Superintendent.</p>


<p class="p2">Tom looked up with a smile. He had got his
bearings at last. There was no doubt about that
signature. His eyes met his wife's, brimming with
sudden joy. The dream of her life was made real.</p>

<p>The railroad men raised a cheer in which there
was a note of regret, for Tom was a prime favorite
with them all, and crowded up to shake hands. The
passengers followed suit, ready to join in, yet mystified
still. But now, when they heard from the
conductor of the Special how Tom by quick action
had saved the Overland, the very train they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
on, from running into a wrecked freight two months
before, many of them remembered the story of it&mdash;how
Tom, being left alone when everybody else lost
his head in the smashup, had sprinted down the
track with torpedoes, while his wife set the switch
and waved the signal lantern, and had just caught
the Limited around the curve, and how narrow had
been the escape from a great disaster. And their
quick sympathy went out to the young couple up
in the lonely heights, who a few moments before
had been less to them than the inert thing of iron
and steel that was panting on the track outside
like a huge monster after a hard run.</p>

<p>When it was learned that both trains were stalled,
perhaps for all night, the recollection that it was
Christmas Eve gave sudden direction to their sympathies.
Since friends on the Coast must wait they
would have their Christmas where they were, if it
were in a snowshed. In less time than any one
could have made a formal motion the trainful of
excited passengers, just now so disgruntled, resolved
itself into a committee of arrangements to which
were added both the train crews.</p>

<p>A young balsam from the mountainside made its
appearance, no one knew exactly how, and in a trice
it shone with a wealth of candles and toys at which
the baby, struggling up to a sitting posture in his
cradle, looked with wide-eyed wonder. The Crogans'
modest living-room was made festive with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
holly and evergreen and transformed into a joyous
dining-room before Mrs. Tom could edge in a word
of protest. All the memories of her cherished Yule
surged in upon her as the room filled with the smell
of roast turkey and mince pie and what not of good
cheer, borne in by a procession of white-clad waiters
who formed a living chain between the dining-car
and the station. When in the wake of them the
veritable rocking-horse, hastily unpacked, was led
in by a hysterical darky, and pranced and pawed
its way across the floor, its reins jingling with silver
bells, Thomas Crogan, Junior, considered it, sitting
bolt upright, one long minute, sighed and, overwhelmed
by such magnificence, went calmly to
sleep. It was too much for one Christmas Eve, and
he not a year old.</p>

<p>When as many as could crowd in were seated
with Tom Crogan and his wife&mdash;the conductors and
engineers of the two trains representing the road&mdash;the
clergyman in the party arose to remind them
all that they were far from home and friends, keeping
Christmas in the mountain wilderness.</p>

<p>"But," he said, "though a continent separates us
we meet with them all here to-night before the face
of Him who came as a helpless Babe to the world
of sin and selfishness, and brought peace and good-will
to men." And he read to them how "It came
to pass in those days, that there went out a decree
from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
taxed," and the story of the Child that is old, yet
will be ever new while the world stands.</p>

<p>In the reverent hush that had fallen upon the
company a tenor voice rose clear and sweet in the
old hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"It came upon the midnight clear</div>
<div class="line i1">That glorious song of old."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the lines were reached:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Still through the cloven skies they come</div>
<div class="line i1">With peaceful wings unfurl'd,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>many of the passengers joined in and sang the verse
to the end. The familiar words seemed to come
with a comforting message to every one in the little
cabin.</p>

<p>In the excitement they had all forgotten the
weather. Unseen by every one the moon had come
out and shone clear in an almost cloudless sky. The
storm was over. A joyful toot of the rotary's whistle,
as dinner neared its end, announced its return
with the welcome news that the road was open once
more.</p>

<p>With many hearty handshakes, and wishes for
happy years to come, the unexpected Christmas
party broke up. But there was yet a small ceremony
left. It was performed by a committee of
three of the Overland passengers who had friends
or kin on board the train Tom Crogan had saved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
They had quietly circulated among the rest, and
now, with the conductor shouting "All aboard!"
they put an envelope into Tom's hand, with the
brief directions "for moving expenses," and jumped
on their car as the engine blew its last warning
whistle and the airbrakes wheezed their farewell.</p>

<p>Tom opened it and saw five crisp twenty-dollar
bills tucked neatly inside.</p>

<p>The Limited pulled out on the stroke of midnight,
with cheering passengers on every step and
in every window. Tom and his wife stood upon
the step of the little station and waved their handkerchiefs
as long as the bull's-eye on the last car
was in sight. When it was gone and they were left
with the snowshed and the Special breathing sleepily
on its siding she laid her head on his shoulder.
A rush of repentant tears welled up and mingled
with the happiness in her voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom!" she said. "Did ye ever know the
like of it? I am fair sorry to leave the old shed."</p>

<h2 id="TOWN">THE OLD TOWN</h2></div>


<p>I do not know how the forty years I have been
away have dealt with "Jule-nissen," the Christmas
elf of my childhood. He was pretty old then, gray
and bent, and there were signs that his time was
nearly over. So it may be that they have laid him
away. I shall find out when I go over there next
time. When I was a boy we never sat down to our
Christmas Eve dinner until a bowl of rice and milk
had been taken up to the attic, where he lived with
the marten and its young, and kept an eye upon
the house&mdash;saw that everything ran smoothly. I
never met him myself, but I know the house-cat
must have done so. No doubt they were well acquainted;
for when in the morning I went in for
the bowl, there it was, quite dry and licked clean,
and the cat purring in the corner. So, being there
all night, he must have seen and likely talked with
him.</p>

<p>I suspect, as I said, that they have not treated
my Nisse fairly in these matter-of-fact days that
have come upon us, not altogether for our own
good, I fear. I am not even certain that they were
quite serious about him then, though to my mind
that was very unreasonable. But then there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
nothing so unreasonable to a child as the cold reason
of the grown-ups. However, if they have gone back
on him, I know where to find him yet. Only last
Christmas when I talked of him to the tenement-house
mothers in my Henry Street Neighborhood
House,<a name="FNanchor1_1" id="FNanchor1_1" href="#Footnote1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;all of them from the ever faithful isle,&mdash;I
saw their eyes light up with the glad smile of
recognition, and half a dozen called out excitedly,
"The Little People! the Leprecawn ye mean, we
know him well," and they were not more pleased
than I to find that we had an old friend in common.
For the Nisse, or the Leprecawn, call him whichever
you like, was a friend indeed to those who loved
kindness and peace. If there was a house in which
contention ruled, either he would have nothing to
do with it, like the stork that built its nest on the
roof, or else he paid the tenants back in their own
coin, playing all kinds of tricks upon them and
making it very uncomfortable. I suppose it was
this trait that gave people, when they began to
reason so much about things, the notion that he was
really the wraith, as it were, of their own disposition,
which was not so at all. I remember the story
told of one man who quarrelled with everybody,
and in consequence had a very troublesome Nisse in
the house that provoked him to the point of moving
away; which he did. But as the load of furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was going down the street, with its owner hugging
himself in glee at the thought that he had stolen
a march on the Nisse, the little fellow poked his
head out of the load and nodded to him, "We are
moving to-day." At which naturally he flew into
a great rage. But then, that was just a story.</p>

<p>The Nisse was of the family, as you see, very
much of it, and certainly not to be classed with
the cattle. Yet they were his special concern; he
kept them quiet, and saw to it, when the stableman
forgot, that they were properly bedded and cleaned
and fed. He was very well known to the hands
about the farm, and they said that he looked just
like a little old man, all in gray and with a pointed
red nightcap and long gray beard. He was always
civilly treated, as he surely deserved to be, but
Christmas was his great holiday, when he became
part of it, indeed, and was made much of. So, for
that matter, was everything that lived under the
husbandman's roof, or within reach of it. The
farmer always set a lighted candle in his window on
Christmas Eve, to guide the lonesome wanderer to
a hospitable hearth. The very sparrows that burrowed
in the straw thatch, and did it no good, were
not forgotten. A sheaf of rye was set out in the
snow for them, so that on that night at least they
should have shelter and warmth unchallenged, and
plenty to eat. At all other times we were permitted
to raid their nests and help ourselves to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
sparrow roast, which was by long odds the greatest
treat we had. Thirty or forty of them, dug out of
any old thatch roof by the light of the stable
lantern and stuffed into Ane's long stocking, which
we had borrowed for a game-bag, made a meal for
the whole family, each sparrow a fat mouthful.
Ane was the cook, and I am very certain that her
pot-roast of sparrow would pass muster at any Fifth
Avenue restaurant as the finest dish of reed-birds
that ever was. However, at Christmas their sheaf
was their sanctuary, and no one as much as squinted
at them. Only last winter when Christmas found
me stranded in a little Michigan town, wandering
disconsolate about the streets, I came across such a
sheaf raised on a pole in a dooryard, and I knew
at once that one of my people lived in that house
and kept Yule in the old way. So I felt as if I
were not quite a stranger.</p>

<p>All the animals knew perfectly well that the
holiday had come, and kept it in their way. The
watch-dog was unchained. In the midnight hour
on the Holy Eve the cattle stood up in their stalls
and bowed out of respect and reverence for Him
who was laid in a manger when there was no room
in the inn, and in that hour speech was given them,
and they talked together. Claus, our neighbor's
man, had seen and heard it, and every Christmas
Eve I meant fully to go and be there when it happened;
but always long before that I had been led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
away to bed, a very sleepy boy, with all my toys
hugged tight, and when I woke up the daylight
shone through the frosted window-panes, and they
were blowing good morning from the church tower;
it would be a whole year before another Christmas.
So I vowed, with a sigh at having neglected a really
sacred observance, that I would be there sure on
the next Christmas Eve. But it was always so,
every year, and perhaps it was just as well, for
Claus said that it might go ill with the one who
listened, if the cows found him out.</p>

<p>Blowing in the Yule from the grim old tower
that had stood eight hundred years against the
blasts of the North Sea was one of the customs of
the Old Town that abide, however it fares with the
Nisse; that I know. At sun-up, while yet the people
were at breakfast, the town band climbed the many
steep ladders to the top of the tower, and up there,
in fair weather or foul,&mdash;and sometimes it blew
great guns from the wintry sea,&mdash;they played four
old hymns, one to each corner of the compass, so
that no one was forgotten. They always began
with Luther's sturdy challenge, "A Mighty Fortress
is our God," while down below we listened devoutly.
There was something both weird and beautiful
about those far-away strains in the early morning
light of the northern winter, something that was
not of earth and that suggested to my child's imagination
the angels' song on far Judean hills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Even now, after all these years, the memory of it
does that. It could not have been because the music
was so rare, for the band was made up of small
storekeepers and artisans who thus turned an honest
penny on festive occasions. Incongruously enough,
I think, the official town mourner who bade people
to funerals was one of them. It was like the
burghers' guard, the colonel of which&mdash;we thought
him at least a general, because of the huge brass
sword he trailed when he marched at the head of
his men&mdash;was the town tailor, a very small but very
martial man. But whether or no, it was beautiful.
I have never heard music since that so moved me.
When the last strain died away came the big bells
with their deep voices that sang far out over field
and heath, and our Yule was fairly under way.</p>

<p>A whole fortnight we kept it. Real Christmas
was from Little Christmas Eve, which was the
night before the Holy Eve proper, till New Year.
Then there was a week of supplementary festivities
before things slipped back into their wonted groove.
That was the time of parties and balls. The great
ball of the year was on the day after Christmas.
Second Christmas Day we called it, when all the
quality attended at the club-house, where the Amtmand
and the Burgomaster, the Bishop and the
Rector of the Latin School, did the honors and
received the people. That was the grandest of the
town functions. The school ball, late in autumn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
was the jolliest, for then the boys invited each the
girl he liked best, and the older people were guests
and outsiders, so to speak. The Latin School, still
the "Cathedral School," was as old as the Domkirke
itself, and when it took the stage it was easily
first while it lasted. The Yule ball, though it was a
rather more formal affair, for all that was neither
stiff nor tiresome; nothing was in the Old Town;
there was too much genuine kindness for that. And
that it was the recognized occasion when matches
were made by enterprising mammas, or by the
young themselves, and when engagements were
declared and discussed as the great news of the
day. We heard of all those things afterward and
thought a great fuss was being made over nothing
much. For when a young couple were declared
engaged, that meant that there was no more fun to
be out of them. They were given, after that, to
go mooning about by themselves and to chasing us
children away when we ran across them; until they
happily returned to their senses, got married, and
became reasonable human beings once more.</p>

<p>When we had been sent to bed on the great
night, Father and Mother went away in their Sunday
very best, and we knew they would not return
until two o'clock in the morning, a fact which alone
invested the occasion with unwonted gravity, for the
Old Town kept early hours. At ten o'clock, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the watchman droned his sleepy lay, absurdly warning
the people to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Be quick and bright,</div>
<div class="line">Watch fire and light,</div>
<div class="line">Our clock it has struck ten,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>it was ordinarily tucked in and asleep. But that
night we lay awake a long time listening to the
muffled sound of heavy wheels in the snow rolling
unceasingly past, and trying to picture to ourselves
the grandeur they conveyed. Every carriage in the
town was then in use and doing overtime. I think
there were as many as four.</p>

<p>When we were not dancing or playing games, we
literally ate our way through the two holiday weeks.
Pastry by the mile did we eat, and general indigestion
brooded over the town when it emerged into
the white light of the new year. At any rate it
ought to have done so. It is a prime article of faith
with the Danes to this day that for any one to go
out of a friend's house, or of anybody's house, in
the Christmas season without partaking of its cheer,
is to "bear away their Yule," which no one must
do on any account. Every house was a bakery from
the middle of December until Christmas Eve, and
oh! the quantities of cakes we ate, and such cakes!
We were sixteen normally, in our home, and Mother
mixed the dough for her cakes in a veritable horse-trough
kept for that exclusive purpose. As much as
a sack of flour went in, I guess, and gallons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
molasses and whatever else went to the mixing.
For weeks there had been long and anxious speculations
as to "what Father would do," and gloomy
conferences between him and Mother over the state
of the family pocket-book, which was never plethoric;
but at last the joyful message ran through
the house from attic to kitchen that the appropriation
had been made, "even for citron," which meant
throwing all care to the winds. The thrill of it,
when we children stood by and saw the generous
avalanche going into the trough! What would not
come out of it! The whole family turned to and
helped make the cakes and cut the "pepper-nuts,"
which were little squares of spiced cake-dough we
played cards for and stuffed our pockets with, gnawing
them incessantly. Talk about eating between
meals: ours was a continuous performance for two
solid weeks. The pepper-nuts were the real staple
of Christmas to us children. We paid forfeits with
them in the game of scratch-nose (jackstraws),
when the fellow fishing for his straw stirred the
others and had his nose scratched with the little file
in the bunch as extra penalty; in "Under which
tree lies my pig?" in which the pig was a pepper-nut,
the fingers of the closed hands the trees; and in
Black Peter. In this last the loser had his nose
blackened with the snuff from the candle until
advancing civilization substituted a burnt cork.
Christmas without pepper-nuts would have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hollow mockery indeed. We rolled the dough in
long strings like slender eels and then cut it, a little
on the bias. They were good, those nuts, when
baked brown. I wish I had some now.</p>

<p>It all stood for the universal desire that in the
joyous season everybody be made glad. I know
that in the Old Town no one went hungry or cold
during the holidays, if indeed any one ever did.
Every one gave of what he had, and no one was
afraid of pauperizing anybody by his gifts, for
they were given gladly and in love, and that makes
all the difference&mdash;did then and does now. At
Christmas it is perfectly safe to let our scientific
principles go and just remember the Lord's command
that we love one another. I subscribe to them
all with perfect loyalty, and try to practise them
till Christmas week comes in with its holly and the
smell of balsam and fir, and the memories of childhood
in the Old Town; then&mdash;well, anyway, it is
only a little while. New Year and the long cold
winter come soon enough.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve was, of course, the great and
blessed time. That was the one night in the year
when in the gray old Domkirke services were held
by candle-light. A myriad wax candles twinkled
in the gloom, but did not dispel it. It lingered
under the great arches where the voice of the venerable
minister, the responses of the congregation, and
above it all the boyish treble of the choir billowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and strove, now dreamily with the memories of ages
past, now sharply, tossed from angle to corner in
the stone walls, and again in long thunderous
echoes, sweeping all before it on the triumphant
strains of the organ, like a victorious army with
banners crowding through the halls of time. So it
sounded to me, as sleep gently tugged at my eyelids.
The air grew heavy with the smell of evergreens
and of burning wax, and as the thunder of war
drew farther and farther away, in the shadow of the
great pillars stirred the phantoms of mailed knights
whose names were hewn in the grave-stones there.
We youngsters clung to the skirts of Mother as we
went out and the great doors fell to behind us.
And yet those Christmas Eves, with Mother's gentle
eyes forever inseparable from them, and with the
glad cries of Merry Christmas ringing all about,
have left a touch of sweet peace in my heart which
all the years have not effaced, nor ever will.</p>

<p>At home the great dinner of the year was waiting
for us; roast goose stuffed with apples and prunes,
rice pudding with cinnamon and sugar on it, and a
great staring butter eye in the middle. The pudding
was to lay the ground-work with, and it was
served in deep soup-plates. It was the dish the
Nisse came in on, and the cat. On New Year's
Eve both these were left out; but to make up for it
an almond was slipped into the "gröd," and whoever
found it in his plate got a present. It was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
device to make people "fletch," but it served the
purpose admirably. At Christmas we had doughnuts
after the goose, big and stout and good. However
I managed it, I don't know, but it is a tradition
in the family, and I remember it well, that I
once ate thirteen on top of the big dinner. Evidently
I was having a good time. Dinner was, if
not the chief end of man, at least an item in his
make-up, and a big one.<a name="FNanchor1_2" id="FNanchor1_2" href="#Footnote1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>When it had had time to settle and all the kitchen
work was done, Father took his seat at the end of
the long table, with all the household gathered
about, the servants included and the baby without
fail, and read the story of The Child: "And it came
to pass in those days," while Mother hushed the
baby. Then we sang together "A Child is Born
in Bethlehem," which was the simplest of our
hymns, and also the one we children loved best,
for it told of how in heaven we were to walk to
church</p>

<p class="p2 center">On sky-blue carpets, star-bedeckt,</p>

<p class="p2">which was a great comfort. Children love beautiful
things, and we had few of them. The great
and precious treasure in our house was the rag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
carpet in the spare room which we were allowed to
enter only on festive occasions such as Christmas.
It had an orange streak in it which I can see to
this day. Whenever I come across one that even
remotely suggests it, it gives me yet a kind of solemn
feeling. We had no piano,&mdash;that was a luxury in
those days,&mdash;and Father was not a singer, but he
led on bravely with his tremulous bass and we all
joined in, Ane the cook and Maria the housemaid
furtively wiping their eyes with their aprons, for
they were good and pious folk and this was their
Christmas service. So we sang the ten verses to
end, with their refrain "Hallelujah! hallelujah,"
that always seemed to me to open the very gates
of Yule.</p>

<p>And it did, literally; for when the last hallelujah
died away the door of the spare room was flung
wide and there stood the Christmas tree, all shining
lights, and the baby was borne in, wide-eyed, to be
the first, as was proper; for was not this The Child's
holiday? Unconsciously we all gave way to those
who were nearest Him, who had most recently come
from His presence and were therefore in closest
touch with the spirit of the holiday. So, when we
joined hands and danced around the tree, Father
held the baby, and we laughed and were happy as
the little one crowed his joy and stretched his tiny
arms toward the light.</p>

<p>Light and shadow, joy and sorrow, go hand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
hand in the world. While we danced and made
merry, there was one near for whom Christmas was
but grief and loss. Out in the white fields he went
from farm to farm, a solitary wanderer, the folklore
had it, looking for plough or harrow on which
to rest his weary limbs. It was the Wandering
Jew, to whom this hope was given, that, if on that
night of all in the year he could find some tool used
in honest toil over which the sign of the cross had
not been made, his wanderings would be at an end
and the curse depart from him, to cleave thence-forward
to the luckless farmer.<a name="FNanchor1_3" id="FNanchor1_3" href="#Footnote1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He never found
what he sought in my time. The thrifty husbandman
had been over his field on the eve of the holiday
with a watchful eye to his coming. When the
bell in the distant church tower struck the midnight
hour, belated travellers heard his sorrowful wail as
he fled over the heath and vanished.</p>

<p>When Ansgarius preached the White Christ to
the vikings of the North, so runs the legend of the
Christmas tree, the Lord sent His three messengers,
Faith, Hope, and Love, to help light the first tree.
Seeking one that should be high as hope, wide as
love, and that bore the sign of the cross on every
bough, they chose the balsam fir, which best of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the trees in the forest met the requirements. Perhaps
that is a good reason why there clings about
the Christmas tree in my old home that which has
preserved it from being swept along in the flood of
senseless luxury that has swamped so many things
in our money-mad day. At least so it was then.
Every time I see a tree studded with electric lights,
garlands of tinsel-gold festooning every branch, and
hung with the hundred costly knicknacks the storekeepers
invent year by year "to make trade," until
the tree itself disappears entirely under its burden,
I have a feeling what a fraud has been practised on
the kindly spirit of Yule. Wax candles are the only
real thing for a Christmas tree, candles of <i>wax</i> that
mingle their perfume with that of the burning fir,
not the by-product of some coal-oil or other abomination.
What if the boughs do catch fire; they can
be watched, and too many candles are tawdry, anyhow.
Also, red apples, oranges, and old-fashioned
cornucopias made of colored paper, and made at
home, look a hundred times better and fitter in the
green; and so do drums and toy trumpets and waldhorns,
and a rocking-horse reined up in front that
need not have cost forty dollars, or anything like it.</p>

<p>I am thinking of one, or rather two, a little piebald
team with a wooden seat between, for which
Mother certainly did not give over seventy-five
cents at the store, that as "Belcher and Mamie"&mdash;the
names were bestowed on the beasts at sight by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Kate, aged three, who bossed the play-room&mdash;gave
a generation of romping children more happiness
than all the expensive railroads and trolley-cars and
steam-engines that are considered indispensable to
keeping Christmas nowadays. And the Noah's Ark
with Noah and his wife and all the animals that
went two by two&mdash;ah, well! I haven't set out to
preach a sermon on extravagance that makes no
one happier, but I wish&mdash;The legend makes me
think of the holly that grew in our Danish woods.
We called it Christ-thorn, for to us it was of that
the crown of thorns was made with which the cruel
soldiers mocked our Saviour, and the red berries
were the drops of blood that fell from His anguished
brow. Therefore the holly was a sacred tree, and
to this day the woods in which I find it seem to me
like the forest where the Christmas roses bloomed
in the night when the Lord was born, different from
all other woods, and better.</p>

<p>Mistletoe was rare in Denmark. There was
known to be but one oak in all the land on which it
grew. But that did not discourage the young. We
had our kissing games which gave the boys and
girls their chance to choose sides, and in the Christmas
season they went on right merrily. There was
rarely a night that did not bring the children together
under some roof or other. They say that
kissing goes by favor, but we had not arrived at that
point yet, though we had our preferences. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
game of Post Office, for instance, he was a bold
boy who would dare call out the girl he really liked,
to get the letter that was supposed to be awaiting
her. You could tell for a dead certainty who was
his choice by watching whom he studiously avoided
asking for. I have a very vivid recollection of having
once really dared with sudden desperation, and
of the defiant flushed face, framed in angry curls,
that confronted me in the hall, the painful silence
while we each stood looking the other way and
heard our playmates tittering behind the closed
door,&mdash;for well they knew,&mdash;and her indignant
stride as she went back to her seat unkissed, with
me trailing behind, feeling like a very sheepish boy,
and no doubt looking the part.</p>

<p>The Old Year went out with much such a racket
as we make nowadays, but of quite a different kind.
We did not blow the New Year in, we "smashed"
it in. When it was dark on New Year's Eve, we
stole out with all the cracked and damaged crockery
of the year that had been hoarded for the purpose
and, hieing ourselves to some favorite neighbor's
door, broke our pots against it. Then we ran, but
not very far or very fast, for it was part of the game
that if one was caught at it, he was to be taken
in and treated to hot doughnuts. The smashing
was a mark of favor, and the citizen who had most
pots broken against his door was the most popular
man in town. When I was in the Latin School, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
cranky burgomaster, whose door had been freshly
painted, gave orders to the watchmen to stop it and
gave them an unhappy night, for they were hard
put to it to find a way it was safe to look, with the
streets full of the best citizens in town, and their
wives and daughters, sneaking singly by with bulging
coats on their way to salute a friend. That
was when our mothers&mdash;those who were not out
smashing in New Year&mdash;came out strong, after the
fashion of mothers. They baked more doughnuts
than ever that night, and beckoned the watchman
in to the treat; and there he sat, blissfully deaf
while the street rang with the thunderous salvos
of our raids; until it was discovered that the burgomaster
himself was on patrol, when there was a
sudden rush from kitchen doors and a great scurrying
through streets that grew strangely silent.</p>

<p>The town had its revenge, however. The burgomaster,
returning home in the midnight hour, stumbled
in his gate over a discarded Christmas tree
hung full of old boots and many black and sooty
pots that went down around him with great smash
in the upset, so that his family came running out in
alarm to find him sprawling in the midst of the
biggest celebration of all. His dignity suffered
a shock which he never got over quite. But it killed
the New Year's fun, too. For he was really a good
fellow, and then he was the burgomaster, and chief
of police to boot. I suspect the fact was that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
pot smashing had run its course. Perhaps the supply
of pots was giving out; we began to use tinware
more about that time. That was the end of it,
anyhow.</p>

<p>We boys got square, too, with the watchmen.
We knew their habit of stowing themselves away in
the stage-coach that stood in the market-place when
they had cried the hour at ten o'clock, and we caught
them napping there one dark night when we were
coming home from a party. The stage had doors
that locked on the outside. We slammed them
shut and ran the conveyance, with them in it wildly
gesticulating from the windows, through the main
street of the town, amid the cheers of the citizens
whom the racket aroused from their slumbers. We
were safe enough. The watchmen were not anxious
to catch us, maddened as they were by our prank,
and they were careful not to report us either. I
chuckled at that exploit more than once when, in
years long after, I went the rounds of the midnight
streets with Haroun-al-Roosevelt, as they called
New York's Police Commissioner, to find his patrolmen
sleeping soundly on their posts when they
should have been catching thieves. Human nature,
police human nature, anyhow, is not so different,
after all, in the old world and in the new.</p>

<p>With Twelfth Night our Yule came to an end.
In that night, if a girl would know her fate, she
must go to bed walking backward and throw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
shoe over her left shoulder, or hide it under her
pillow, I forget which, perhaps both, and say aloud
a verse that prayed the Three Holy Kings to show
her the man</p>

<p>The man who appeared to her in her sleep was to
be her husband. There was no escape from it, and
consequently she did not try. He was her Christmas
gift, and she took him for better or for worse.
Let us hope that the Nisse played her no scurvy

<h2 id="GIFT">HIS CHRISTMAS GIFT</h2></div>


<p>"The prisoner will stand," droned out the clerk
in the Court of General Sessions. "Filippo Portoghese,
you are convicted of assault with intent to
kill. Have you anything to say why sentence
should not be passed upon you?"</p>

<p>A sallow man with a hopeless look in his heavy
eyes rose slowly in his seat and stood facing the
judge. There was a pause in the hum and bustle of
the court as men turned to watch the prisoner. He
did not look like a man who would take a neighbor's
life, and yet so nearly had he done so, of set
purpose it had been abundantly proved, that his
victim would carry the disfiguring scar of the bullet
to the end of his life, and only by what seemed
an almost miraculous chance had escaped death.
The story as told by witnesses and substantially
uncontradicted was this:</p>

<p>Portoghese and Vito Ammella, whom he shot,
were neighbors under the same roof. Ammella kept
the grocery on the ground floor. Portoghese lived
upstairs in the tenement. He was a prosperous,
peaceful man, with a family of bright children, with
whom he romped and played happily when home
from his barber shop. The Black Hand fixed its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
evil eye upon the family group and saw its chance.
One day a letter came demanding a thousand dollars.
Portoghese put it aside with the comment
that this was New York, not Italy. Other letters
followed, threatening harm to his children. Portoghese
paid no attention, but his wife worried. One
day the baby, little Vito, was missing, and in hysterics
she ran to her husband's shop crying that the
Black Hand had stolen the child.</p>

<p>The barber hurried home and sought high and
low. At last he came upon the child sitting on
Ammella's doorstep; he had wandered away and
brought up at the grocery; asked where he had been,
the child pointed to the store. Portoghese flew in
and demanded to know what Ammella was doing
with his boy. The grocer was in a bad humor, and
swore at him. There was an altercation, and Ammella
attacked the barber with a broom, beating him
and driving him away from his door. Black with
anger, Portoghese ran to his room and returned
with a revolver. In the fight that followed he shot
Ammella through the head.</p>

<p>He was arrested and thrown into jail. In the
hospital the grocer hovered between life and death
for many weeks. Portoghese lay in the Tombs
awaiting trial for more than a year, believing still
that he was the victim of a Black Hand conspiracy.
When at last the trial came on, his savings
were all gone, and of the once prosperous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
happy man only a shadow was left. He sat in the
court-room and listened in moody silence to the
witnesses who told how he had unjustly suspected
and nearly murdered his friend. He was speedily
convicted, and the day of his sentence was fixed
for Christmas Eve. It was certain that it would
go hard with him. The Italians were too prone to
shoot and stab, said the newspapers, and the judges
were showing no mercy.</p>

<p>The witnesses had told the truth, but there were
some things they did not know and that did not
get into the evidence. The prisoner's wife was ill
from grief and want; their savings of years gone to
lawyer's fees, they were on the verge of starvation.
The children were hungry. With the bells ringing
in the glad holiday, they were facing bitter homelessness
in the winter streets, for the rent was in
arrears and the landlord would not wait. And
"Papa" away now for the second Christmas, and
maybe for many yet to come! Ten, the lawyer and
jury had said: this was New York, not Italy. In
the Tombs the prisoner said it over to himself,
bitterly. He had thought only of defending his
own.</p>

<p>So now he stood looking the judge and the jury
in the face, yet hardly seeing them. He saw only
the prison gates opening for him, and the gray
walls shutting him out from his wife and little
ones for&mdash;how many Christmases was it? One,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
two, three&mdash;he fell to counting them over mentally
and did not hear when his lawyer whispered and
nudged him with his elbow. The clerk repeated his
question, but he merely shook his head. What
should he have to say? Had he not said it to these
men and they did not believe him? About little
Vito who was lost, and his wife who cried her eyes
out because of the Black Hand letters. He&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a step behind him, and a voice he
knew spoke. It was the voice of Ammella, his
neighbor, with whom he used to be friends before&mdash;before
that day.</p>

<p>"Please, your Honor, let this man go! It is
Christmas, and we should have no unkind thoughts.
I have none against Filippo here, and I ask you to
let him go."</p>

<p>It grew very still in the court-room as he spoke
and paused for an answer. Lawyers looked up
from their briefs in astonishment. The jurymen
in the box leaned forward and regarded the convicted
man and his victim with rapt attention.
Such a plea had not been heard in that place before.
Portoghese stood mute; the voice sounded strange
and far away to him. He felt a hand upon his
shoulder that was the hand of a friend, and shifted
his feet uncertainly, but made no response. The
gray-haired judge regarded the two gravely but
kindly.</p>

<p>"Your wish comes from a kind heart," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
"But this man has been convicted. The law must
be obeyed. There is nothing in it that allows us
to let a guilty man go free."</p>

<p>The jurymen whispered together and one of them
arose.</p>

<p>"Your Honor," he said, "a higher law than any
made by man came into the world at Christmas&mdash;that
we love one another. These men would obey
it. Will you not let them? The jury pray as one
man that you let mercy go before justice on this
Holy Eve."</p>

<p>A smile lit up Judge O'Sullivan's face. "Filippo
Portoghese," he said, "you are a very fortunate
man. The law bids me send you to prison for ten
years, and but for a miraculous chance would have
condemned you to death. But the man you maimed
for life pleads for you, and the jury that convicted
you begs that you go free. The Court remembers
what you have suffered and it knows the plight of
your family, upon whom the heaviest burden of
your punishment would fall. Go, then, to your
home. And to you, gentlemen, a happy holiday
such as you have given him and his! This court
stands adjourned."</p>

<p>The voice of the crier was lost in a storm of applause.
The jury rose to their feet and cheered
judge, complainant, and defendant. Portoghese,
who had stood as one dazed, raised eyes that
brimmed with tears to the bench and to his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
neighbor. He understood at last. Ammella threw
his arm around him and kissed him on both cheeks,
his disfigured face beaming with joy. One of the
jurymen, a Jew, put his hand impulsively in his
pocket, emptied it into his hat, and passed the hat
to his neighbor. All the others followed his example.
The court officer dropped in half a dollar
as he stuffed its contents into the happy Italian's
pocket. "For little Vito," he said, and shook his
hand.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the foreman of the jury, looking after
the reunited friends leaving the court-room arm in
arm; "it is good to live in New York. A merry
Christmas to you, Judge!"</p>

<h2 id="BABIES">THE SNOW BABIES' CHRISTMAS</h2></div>


<p>"All aboard for Coney Island!" The gates of
the bridge train slammed, the whistle shrieked, and
the cars rolled out past rows of houses that grew
smaller and lower to Jim's wondering eyes, until
they quite disappeared beneath the track. He felt
himself launching forth above the world of men,
and presently he saw, deep down below, the broad
stream with ships and ferry-boats and craft going
different ways, just like the tracks and traffic in a
big, wide street; only so far away was it all that
the pennant on the topmast of a vessel passing
directly under the train seemed as if it did not
belong to his world at all. Jim followed the white
foam in the wake of the sloop with fascinated stare,
until a puffing tug bustled across its track and
wiped it out. Then he settled back in his seat with
a sigh that had been pent up within him twenty
long, wondering minutes since he limped down the
Subway at Twenty-third Street. It was his first
journey abroad.</p>

<p>Jim had never been to the Brooklyn Bridge before.
It is doubtful if he had ever heard of it. If
he had, it was as of something so distant, so unreal,
as to have been quite within the realm of fairyland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
had his life experience included fairies. It had not.
Jim's frail craft had been launched in Little Italy,
half a dozen miles or more up-town, and there it
had been moored, its rovings being limited at the
outset by babyhood and the tenement, and later on
by the wreck that had made of him a castaway for
life. A mysterious something had attacked one of
Jim's ankles, and, despite ointments and lotions
prescribed by the wise women of the tenement, had
eaten into the bone and stayed there. At nine the
lad was a cripple with one leg shorter than the other
by two or three inches, with a stepmother, a squalling
baby to mind for his daily task, hard words and
kicks for his wage; for Jim was an unprofitable investment,
promising no returns, but, rather, constant
worry and outlay. The outlook was not the
most cheering in the world.</p>

<p>But, happily, Jim was little concerned about
things to come. He lived in the day that is, fighting
his way as he could with a leg and a half and a
nickname,&mdash;"Gimpy" they called him for his limp,&mdash;and
getting out of it what a fellow so handicapped
could. After all, there were compensations.
When the gang scattered before the cop, it did not
occur to him to lay any of the blame to Gimpy,
though the little lad with the pinched face and
sharp eyes had, in fact, done scouting duty most
craftily. It was partly in acknowledgment of such
services, partly as a concession to his sharper wits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that Gimpy was tacitly allowed a seat in the councils
of the Cave Gang, though in the far "kid"
corner. He limped through their campaigns with
them, learned to swim by "dropping off the dock"
at the end of the street into the swirling tide, and
once nearly lost his life when one of the bigger boys
dared him to run through an election bonfire like
his able-bodied comrades. Gimpy started to do it
at once, but stumbled and fell, and was all but
burned to death before the other boys could pull
him out. This act of bravado earned him full membership
in the gang, despite his tender years; and,
indeed, it is doubtful if in all that region there was
a lad of his age as tough and loveless as Gimpy.
The one affection of his barren life was the baby
that made it slavery by day. But, somehow, there
was that in its chubby foot groping for him in its
baby sleep, or in the little round head pillowed on
his shoulder, that more than made up for it all.</p>

<p>Ill luck was surely Gimpy's portion. It was not
a month after he had returned to the haunts of the
gang, a battle-scarred veteran now since his encounter
with the bonfire, when "the Society's" officers
held up the huckster's wagon from which he
was crying potatoes with his thin, shrill voice, which
somehow seemed to convey the note of pain that was
the prevailing strain of his life. They made Gimpy
a prisoner, limp, stick, and all. The inquiry that
ensued as to his years and home setting, the while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Gimpy was undergoing the incredible experience of
being washed and fed regularly three times a day,
set in motion the train of events that was at present
hurrying him toward Coney Island in midwinter,
with a snow-storm draping the land in white far
and near, as the train sped seaward. He gasped as
he reviewed the hurrying event of the week: the
visit of the doctor from Sea Breeze, who had scrutinized
his ankle as if he expected to find some of the
swag of the last raid hidden somewhere about it.
Gimpy never took his eyes off him during the examination.
No word or cry escaped him when it
hurt most, but his bright, furtive eyes never left the
doctor or lost one of his movements. "Just like a
weasel caught in a trap," said the doctor, speaking
of his charge afterward.</p>

<p>But when it was over, he clapped Gimpy on the
shoulder and said it was all right. He was sure he
could help.</p>

<p>"Have him at the Subway to-morrow at twelve,"
was his parting direction; and Gimpy had gone to
bed to dream that he was being dragged down the
stone stairs by three helmeted men, to be fed to a
monster breathing fire and smoke at the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>Now his wondering journey was disturbed by a
cheery voice beside him. "Well, bub, ever see that
before?" and the doctor pointed to the gray ocean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
line dead ahead. Gimpy had not seen it, but he
knew well enough what it was.</p>

<p>"It's the river," he said, "that I cross when I go
to Italy."</p>

<p>"Right!" and his companion held out a helping
hand as the train pulled up at the end of the journey.
"Now let's see how we can navigate."</p>

<p>And, indeed, there was need of seeing about it.
Right from the step of the train the snow lay deep,
a pathless waste burying street and sidewalk out
of sight, blocking the closed and barred gate of
Dreamland, of radiant summer memory, and stalling
the myriad hobby-horses of shows that slept
their long winter sleep. Not a whinny came on the
sharp salt breeze. The strident voice of the carpenter's
saw and the rat-tat-tat of his hammer alone
bore witness that there was life somewhere in the
white desert. The doctor looked in dismay at
Gimpy's brace and high shoe, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"He never can do it. Hello, there!" An express
wagon had come into view around the corner
of the shed. "Here's a job for you." And before
he could have said Jack Robinson, Gimpy felt himself
hoisted bodily into the wagon and deposited
there like any express package. From somewhere
a longish something that proved to be a Christmas-tree,
very much wrapped and swathed about, came
to keep him company. The doctor climbed up by
the driver, and they were off. Gimpy recalled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a dull sense of impending events in which for once
he had no shaping hand, as he rubbed his ears where
the bitter blast pinched, that to-morrow was Christmas.</p>

<p>A strange group was that which gathered about
the supper-table at Sea Breeze that night. It would
have been sufficiently odd to any one anywhere;
but to Gimpy, washed, in clean, comfortable raiment,
with his bad foot set in a firm bandage, and
for once no longer sore with the pain that had
racked his frame from babyhood, it seemed so unreal
that once or twice he pinched himself covertly
to see if he were really awake. They came weakly
stumping with sticks and crutches and on club feet,
the lame and the halt, the children of sorrow and
suffering from the city slums, and stood leaning on
crutch or chair for support while they sang their
simple grace; but neither in their clear childish
voices nor yet in the faces that were turned toward
Gimpy in friendly scrutiny as the last comer, was
there trace of pain. Their cheeks were ruddy and
their eyes bright with the health of outdoors, and
when they sang about the "Frog in the Pond,"
in response to a spontaneous demand, laughter
bubbled over around the table. Gimpy, sizing his
fellow-boarders up according to the standards of
the gang, with the mental conclusion that he "could
lick the bunch," felt a warm little hand worming its
way into his, and, looking into a pair of trustful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
baby eyes, choked with a sudden reminiscent pang,
but smiled back at his friend and felt suddenly at
home. Little Ellen, with the pervading affections,
had added him to her family of brothers. What
honors were in store for him in that relation Gimpy
never guessed. Ellen left no one out. When
summer came again she enlarged the family further
by adopting the President of the United States
as her papa, when he came visiting to Sea Breeze;
and by rights Gimpy should have achieved a pull
such as would have turned the boss of his ward
green with envy.</p>

<p>It appeared speedily that something unusual was
on foot. There was a subdued excitement among
the children which his experience diagnosed at first
flush as the symptoms of a raid. But the fact that
in all the waste of snow on the way over he had seen
nothing rising to the apparent dignity of candy-shop
or grocery-store made him dismiss the notion
as untenable. Presently unfamiliar doings developed.
The children who could write scribbled
notes on odd sheets of paper, which the nurses
burned in the fireplace with solemn incantations.
Something in the locked dining-room was an object
of pointed interest. Things were going on there,
and expeditions to penetrate the mystery were organized
at brief intervals, and as often headed off
by watchful nurses.</p>

<p>When, finally, the children were gotten upstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and undressed, from the headposts of each of thirty-six
beds there swung a little stocking, limp and
yawning with mute appeal. Gimpy had "caught
on" by this time: it was a wishing-bee, and old
Santa Claus was supposed to fill the stockings with
what each had most desired. The consultation over,
baby George had let him into the game. Baby
George did not know enough to do his own wishing,
and the thirty-five took it in hand while he was
being put to bed.</p>

<p>"Let's wish for some little dresses for him," said
big Mariano, who was the baby's champion and
court of last resort; "that's what he needs." And
it was done. Gimpy smiled a little disdainfully
at the credulity of the "kids." The Santa Claus
fake was out of date a long while in his tenement.
But he voted for baby George's dresses, all the
same, and even went to the length of recording his
own wish for a good baseball bat. Gimpy was
coming on.</p>

<p>Going to bed in that queer place fairly "stumped"
Gimpy. "Peelin'" had been the simplest of processes
in Little Italy. Here they pulled a fellow's
clothes off only to put on another lot, heavier every
way, with sweater and hood and flannel socks and
mittens to boot, as if the boy were bound for a
tussle with the storm outside rather than for his
own warm bed. And so, in fact, he was. For no
sooner had he been tucked under the blankets, warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and snug, than the nurses threw open all the windows,
every one, and let the gale from without
surge in and through as it listed; and so they left
them. Gimpy shivered as he felt the frosty breath
of the ocean nipping his nose, and crept under the
blanket for shelter. But presently he looked up
and saw the other boys snoozing happily like so
many little Eskimos equipped for the North Pole,
and decided to keep them company. For a while
he lay thinking of the strange things that had happened
that day, since his descent into the Subway.
If the gang could see him now. But it seemed far
away, with all his past life&mdash;farther than the river
with the ships deep down below. Out there upon
the dark waters, in the storm, were they sailing now,
and all the lights of the city swallowed up in
gloom? Presently he heard through it all the train
roaring far off in the Subway and many hurrying
feet on the stairs. The iron gates clanked&mdash;and he
fell asleep with the song of the sea for his lullaby.
Mother Nature had gathered her child to her bosom,
and the slum had lost in the battle for a life.</p>

<p>The clock had not struck two when from the biggest
boy's bed in the corner there came in a clear,
strong alto the strains of "Ring, ring, happy bells!"
and from every room childish voices chimed in. The
nurses hurried to stop the chorus with the message
that it was yet five hours to daylight. They were
up, trimming the tree in the dining-room; at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
last moment the crushing announcement had been
made that the candy had been forgotten, and a midnight
expedition had set out for the city through the
storm to procure it. A semblance of order was restored,
but cat naps ruled after that, till, at day-break,
a gleeful shout from Ellen's bed proclaimed
that Santa Claus had been there, in very truth, and
had left a dolly in her stocking. It was the signal
for such an uproar as had not been heard on that
beach since Port Arthur fell for the last time upon
its defenders three months before. From thirty-six
stockings came forth a veritable army of tops, balls,
wooden animals of unknown pedigree, oranges,
music-boxes, and cunning little pocket-books, each
with a shining silver quarter in, love-tokens of one
in the great city whose heart must have been light
with happy dreams in that hour. Gimpy drew
forth from his stocking a very able-bodied baseball
bat and considered it with a stunned look. Santa
Claus was a fake, but the bat&mdash;there was no denying
that, and he <i>had</i> wished for one the very last
thing before he fell asleep!</p>

<p>Daylight struggled still with a heavy snow-squall
when the signal was given for the carol "Christmas
time has come again," and the march down to
breakfast. That march! On the third step the
carol was forgotten and the band broke into one
long cheer that was kept up till the door of the
dining-room was reached. At the first glimpse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
within, baby George's wail rose loud and grievous:
"My chair! my chair!" But it died in a shriek of
joy as he saw what it was that had taken its place.
There stood the Christmas-tree, one mass of shining
candles, and silver and gold, and angels with wings,
and wondrous things of colored paper all over it
from top to bottom. Gimpy's eyes sparkled at the
sight, skeptic though he was at nine; and in the
depths of his soul he came over, then and there,
to Santa Claus, to abide forever&mdash;only he did not
know it yet.</p>

<p>To make the children eat any breakfast, with
three gay sleds waiting to take the girls out in the
snow, was no easy matter; but it was done at last,
and they swarmed forth for a holiday in the open.
All days are spent in the open at Sea Breeze,&mdash;even
the school is a tent,&mdash;and very cold weather
only shortens the brief school hour; but this day
was to be given over to play altogether. Winter it
was "for fair," but never was coasting enjoyed on
New England hills as these sledding journeys on
the sands where the surf beat in with crash of
thunder. The sea itself had joined in making
Christmas for its little friends. The day before, a
regiment of crabs had come ashore and surrendered
to the cook at Sea Breeze. Christmas morn found
the children's "floor"&mdash;they called the stretch of
clean, hard sand between high-water mark and the
surf-line by that name&mdash;filled with gorgeous shells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and pebbles, and strange fishes left there by the tide
overnight. The fair-weather friends who turn their
backs upon old ocean with the first rude blasts of
autumn little know what wonderful surprises it
keeps for those who stand by it in good and in evil
report.</p>

<p>When the very biggest turkey that ever strutted
in barnyard was discovered steaming in the middle
of the dinner-table and the report went round in
whispers that ice-cream had been seen carried in
pails, and when, in response to a pull at the bell,
Matron Thomsen ushered in a squad of smiling
mamas and papas to help eat the dinner, even
Gimpy gave in to the general joy, and avowed that
Christmas was "bully." Perhaps his acceptance of
the fact was made easier by a hasty survey of the
group of papas and mamas, which assured him that
his own were not among them. A fleeting glimpse
of the baby, deserted and disconsolate, brought the
old pucker to his brow for a passing moment; but
just then big Fred set off a snapper at his very ear,
and thrusting a pea-green fool's-cap upon his head,
pushed him into the roistering procession that hobbled
round and round the table, cheering fit to
burst. And the babies that had been brought down
from their cribs, strapped, because their backs were
crooked, in the frames that look so cruel and are so
kind, lifted up their feeble voices as they watched
the show with shining eyes. Little baby Helen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
who could only smile and wave "by-by" with one
fat hand, piped in with her tiny voice, "Here I is!"
It was all she knew, and she gave that with a right
good will, which is as much as one can ask of anybody,
even of a snow baby.</p>

<p>If there were still lacking a last link to rivet
Gimpy's loyalty to his new home for good and all,
he himself supplied it when the band gathered under
the leafless trees&mdash;for Sea Breeze has a grove in
summer, the only one on the island&mdash;and whiled
away the afternoon making a "park" in the snow,
with sea-shells for curbing and boundary stones.
When it was all but completed, Gimpy, with an
inspiration that then and there installed him leader,
gave it the finishing touch by drawing a policeman
on the corner with a club, and a sign, "Keep off the
grass." Together they gave it the air of reality
and the true local color that made them feel, one
and all, that now indeed they were at home.</p>

<p>Toward evening a snow-storm blew in from the
sea, but instead of scurrying for shelter, the little
Eskimos joined the doctor in hauling wood for a
big bonfire on the beach. There, while the surf
beat upon the shore hardly a dozen steps away, and
the storm whirled the snow-clouds in weird drifts
over sea and land, they drew near the fire, and
heard the doctor tell stories that seemed to come
right out of the darkness and grow real while they
listened. Dr. Wallace is a southerner and lived his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
childhood with Br'er Rabbit and Mr. Fox, and they
saw them plainly gamboling in the firelight as the
story went on. For the doctor knows boys and loves
them, that is how.</p>

<p>No one would have guessed that they were cripples,
every one of that rugged band that sat down
around the Christmas supper-table, rosy-cheeked
and jolly&mdash;cripples condemned, but for Sea Breeze,
to lives of misery and pain, most of them to an
early death and suffering to others. For their enemy
was that foe of mankind, the White Plague, that
for thousands of years has taken tithe and toll of
the ignorance and greed and selfishness of man,
which sometimes we call with one name&mdash;the slum.
Gimpy never would have dreamed that the tenement
held no worse threat for the baby he yearned
for than himself, with his crippled foot, when he
was there. These things you could not have told
even the fathers and mothers; or if you had, no one
there but the doctor and the nurses would have believed
you. They knew only too well. But two
things you could make out, with no trouble at all,
by the lamplight: one, that they were one and all
on the homeward stretch to health and vigor&mdash;Gimpy
himself was a different lad from the one
who had crept shivering to bed the night before;
and this other, that they were the sleepiest crew of
youngsters ever got together. Before they had
finished the first verse of "America" as their good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
night, standing up like little men, half of them
were down and asleep with their heads pillowed
upon their arms. And so Miss Brass, the head nurse,
gathered them in and off to bed.</p>

<p>"And now, boys," she said as they were being
tucked in, "your prayers." And of those who were
awake each said his own: Willie his "Now I lay
me," Mariano his "Ave," but little Bent from the
Eastside tenement wailed that he didn't have any.
Bent was a newcomer like Gimpy.</p>

<p>"Then," said six-year-old Morris, resolutely,&mdash;he
also was a Jew,&mdash;"I learn him mine vat my
fader tol' me." And getting into Bent's crib, he
crept under the blanket with his little comrade.
Gimpy saw them reverently pull their worsted caps
down over their heads, and presently their tiny
voices whispered together, in the jargon of the East
Side, their petition to the Father of all, who looked
lovingly down through the storm upon his children
of many folds.</p>

<p>The last prayer was said, and all was still.
Through the peaceful breathing of the boys all
about him, Gimpy, alone wakeful, heard the deep
bass of the troubled sea. The storm had blown
over. Through the open windows shone the eternal
stars, as on that night in the Judean hills when
shepherds herded their flocks and</p>

<p class="p2 center">"The angels of the Lord came down."</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
He did not know. He was not thinking of angels;
none had ever come to his slum. But a great peace
came over him and filled his child-soul. It may be
that the nurse saw it shining in his eyes and thought
it fever. It may be that she, too, was thinking in
that holy hour. She bent over him and laid a soothing
hand upon his brow.</p>

<p>"You must sleep now," she said.</p>

<p>Something that was not of the tenement, something
vital, with which his old life had no concern,
welled up in Gimpy at the touch. He caught
her hand and held it.</p>

<p>"I will if you will sit here," he said. He could
not help it.</p>

<p>"Why, Jimmy?" She stroked back his shock of
stubborn hair. Something glistened on her eyelashes
as she looked at the forlorn little face on
the pillow. How should Gimpy know that he was
at that moment leading another struggling soul by
the hand toward the light that never dies?</p>

<p>"'Cause," he gulped hard, but finished manfully&mdash;"'cause
I love you."</p>

<p>Gimpy had learned the lesson of Christmas,</p>

<p class="p2 center">"And glory shone around."</p>

<h2 id="SERMON">JACK'S SERMON</h2></div>


<p>Jack sat on the front porch in a very bad humor
indeed. That was in itself something unusual
enough to portend trouble; for ordinarily Jack was
a philosopher well persuaded that, upon the whole,
this was a very good world and Deacon Pratt's
porch the centre of it on week-days. On Sundays
it was transferred to the village church, and on these
days Jack received there with the family. If the
truth were told, it would probably have been found
that Jack conceived the services to be some sort of
function specially designed to do him honor at
proper intervals, for he always received an extra
petting on these occasions. He sat in the pew beside
the deacon through the sermon as decorously as befitted
a dog come to years of discretion long since,
and wagged his tail in a friendly manner when the
minister came down and patted him on the head
after the benediction. Outside he met the Sunday-school
children on their own ground, and on their
own terms. Jack, if he didn't have blood, had sense,
which for working purposes is quite as good, if not
so common. The girls gave him candy and called
him Jack Sprat. His joyous bark could be heard
long after church as he romped with the boys by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
creek on the way home. It was even suspected that
on certain Sabbaths they had enjoyed a furtive
cross-country run together; but by tacit consent the
village overlooked it and put it down to the dog.
Jack was privileged and not to blame. There was
certainly something, from the children's point of
view, also, in favor of Jack's conception of Sunday.</p>

<p>On week-day nights there were the church meetings
of one kind and another, for which Deacon
Pratt's house was always the place, not counting the
sociables which Jack attended with unfailing regularity.
They would not, any of them, have been
quite regular without Jack. Indeed, many a question
of grave church polity had been settled only
after it had been submitted to and passed upon in
meeting by Jack. "Is not that so, Jack?" was a
favorite clincher to arguments which, it was felt,
had won over his master. And Jack's groping paw
cemented a treaty of good-will and mutual concession
that had helped the village church over more
than one hard place. For there were hard heads
and stubborn wills in it as there are in other
churches; and Deacon Pratt, for all he was a just
man, was set on having his way.</p>

<p>And now all this was changed. What had come
over the town Jack couldn't make out, but that it
was something serious nobody was needed to tell
him. Folks he used to meet at the gate, going to
the trains of mornings, on neighborly terms, hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
past him without as much as a look. Deacon Jones,
who gave him ginger-snaps out of the pantry-crock
as a special bribe for a hand-shake, had even put out
his foot to kick him, actually kick him, when he waylaid
him at the corner that morning. The whole
week there had not been as much as a visitor at the
house, and what with Christmas in town&mdash;Jack
knew the signs well enough; they meant raisins and
goodies that came only when they burned candles
on trees in the church&mdash;it was enough to make any
dog cross. To top it all, his mistress must come
down sick, worried into it all, as like as not, he had
heard the doctor say. If Jack's thoughts could have
been put into words as he sat on the porch looking
moodily over the road, they would doubtless have
taken something like this shape, that it was a pity
that men didn't have the sense of dogs, but would
bear grudges and make themselves and their betters
unhappy. And in the village there would have been
more than one to agree with him secretly.</p>

<p>Jack wouldn't have been any the wiser had he
been told that the trouble that had come to town
was that of all things most worrisome, a church
quarrel. What was it about and how did it come?
I doubt if any of the men and women who strove
in meeting for principle and conscience with might
and main, and said mean things about each other
out of meeting, could have explained it. I know
they all would have explained it differently, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
added fuel to the fire that was hot enough already.
In fact, that was what had happened the night before
Jack encountered his special friend, Deacon
Jones, and it was in virtue of his master's share in
it that he had bestowed the memorable kick upon
him. Deacon Pratt was the valiant leader of the
opposing faction.</p>

<p>To the general stress of mind the holiday had but
added another cause of irritation. Could Jack have
understood the ethics of men he would have known
that it strangely happens that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Forgiveness to the injured does belong,</div>
<div class="line">But they ne'er pardon who have done the wrong,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and that everybody in a church quarrel having injured
everybody else within reach for conscience
sake, the season of good-will and even the illness of
that good woman, the wife of Deacon Pratt, admittedly
from worry over the trouble, practically
put a settlement of it out of the question. But being
only a dog he did not understand. He could only
sulk; and as this went well enough with things as
they were in general, it proved that Jack was, as was
well known, a very intelligent dog.</p>

<p>He had yet to give another proof of it, that very
day, by preaching to the divided congregation its
Christmas sermon, a sermon that is to this day
remembered in Brownville; but of that neither they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
nor he, sitting there on the stoop nursing his grievances,
had at that time any warning.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve. Since the early Lutherans
settled there, away back in the last century, it had
been the custom in the village to celebrate the Holy
Eve with a special service and a Christmas tree;
and preparations had been going forward for it all
the afternoon. It was noticeable that the fighting
in the congregation in no wise interfered with the
observance of the established forms of worship;
rather, it seemed to lend a keener edge to them. It
was only the spirit that suffered. Jack, surveying
the road from the porch, saw baskets and covered
trays carried by, and knew their contents. He had
watched the big Christmas tree going down on the
grocer's sled, and his experience plus his nose supplied
the rest. As the lights came out one by one
after twilight, he stirred uneasily at the unwonted
stillness in his house. Apparently no one was getting
ready for church. Could it be that they were
not going; that this thing was to be carried to the
last ditch? He decided to go and investigate.</p>

<p>His investigations were brief, but entirely conclusive.
For the second time that day he was
spurned, and by a friend. This time it was the
deacon himself who drove him from his wife's room,
whither he had betaken him with true instinct to
ascertain the household intentions. The deacon
seemed to be, if anything, in a worse humor than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
even Jack himself. The doctor had told him that
afternoon that Mrs. Pratt was a very sick woman,
and that, if she was to pull through at all, she must
be kept from all worriment in an atmosphere which
fairly bristled with it. The deacon felt that he had
a contract on his hands which might prove too
heavy for him. He felt, too, with bitterness, that
he was an ill-used man, that all his years of faithful
labor in the vineyard went for nothing because of
some wretched heresy which the enemy had devised
to wreck it; and all his humbled pride and his pent-up
wrath gathered itself into the kick with which
he sent poor Jack flying back where he had come
from. It was clear that the deacon was not going
to church.</p>

<p>Lonely and forsaken, Jack took his old seat on the
porch and pondered. The wrinkles in his brow multiplied
and grew deeper as he looked down the road
and saw the Joneses, the Smiths, and the Allens go
by toward the church. When the Merritts had
passed, too, under the lamp, he knew that it must
be nearly time for the sermon. They always came
in after the long prayer. Jack took a turn up and
down the porch, whined at the door once, and, receiving
no answer, set off down the road by himself.</p>

<p>The church was filled. It had never looked handsomer.
The rival factions had vied with each other
in decorating it. Spruce and hemlock sprouted
everywhere, and garlands of ground-ivy festooned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
walls and chancel. The delicious odor of balsam
and of burning wax-candles was in the air. The
people were all there in their Sunday clothes and the
old minister in the pulpit; but the Sunday feeling
was not there. Something was not right. Deacon
Pratt's pew alone of them all was empty, and the
congregation cast wistful glances at it, some secretly
behind their hymn-books, others openly and sorrowfully.
What the doctor had said in the afternoon
had got out. He himself had told Mrs. Mills that
it was doubtful if the deacon's wife got around, and
it sat heavily upon the conscience of the people.</p>

<p>The opening hymns were sung; the Merritts, late
as usual, had taken their seats. The minister took
up the Book to read the Christmas gospel from the
second chapter of Luke. He had been there longer
than most of those who were in the church to-night
could remember, had grown old with the people,
had loved them as the shepherd who is answerable
to the Master for his flock. Their griefs and their
troubles were his. If he could not ward them off,
he could suffer with them. His voice trembled a
little as he read of the tidings of great joy. Perhaps
it was age; but it grew firmer as he proceeded
toward the end:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude
of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good-will toward men.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The old minister closed the Book and looked out
over the congregation. He looked long and yearningly,
and twice he cleared his throat, only to repeat,
"on earth peace, good-will toward men." The people
settled back in their seats, uneasily; they
strangely avoided the eye of their pastor. It rested
in its slow survey of the flock upon Deacon Pratt's
empty pew. And at that moment a strange thing
occurred.</p>

<p>Why it should seem strange was, perhaps, not the
least strange part of it. Jack had come in alone
before. He knew the trick of the door-latch, and
had often opened it unaided. He was in the habit
of attending the church with the folks; there was
no reason why they should not expect him, unless
they knew of one themselves. But somehow the
click of the latch went clear through the congregation
as the heavenly message of good-will had not.
All eyes were turned upon the deacon's pew; and
they waited.</p>

<p>Jack came slowly and gravely up the aisle and
stopped at his master's pew. He sniffed of the
empty seat disapprovingly once or twice&mdash;he had
never seen it in that state before&mdash;then he climbed
up and sat, serious and attentive as he was wont,
in his old seat, facing the pulpit, nodding once as
who should say, "I'm here; proceed!"</p>

<p>It is recorded that not even a titter was heard
from the Sunday-school, which was out in force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
In the silence that reigned in the church was heard
only a smothered sob. The old minister looked
with misty eyes at his friend. He took off his
spectacles, wiped them and put them on again, and
tried to speak; but the tears ran down his cheeks
and choked his voice. The congregation wept with
him.</p>

<p>"Brethren," he said, when he could speak, "glory
to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will
toward men! Jack has preached a better sermon
than I can to-night. Let us pray together."</p>

<p>It is further recorded that the first and only
quarrel in the Brownville church ended on Christmas
Eve and was never heard of again, and that it
was all the work of Jack's sermon.</p>

<h2 id="TENEMENTS">MERRY CHRISTMAS IN THE TENEMENTS</h2></div>


<p>It was just a sprig of holly, with scarlet berries
showing against the green, stuck in, by one of the
office boys probably, behind the sign that pointed
the way up to the editorial rooms. There was no
reason why it should have made me start when I
came suddenly upon it at the turn of the stairs; but
it did. Perhaps it was because that dingy hall,
given over to dust and draughts all the days of the
year, was the last place in which I expected to meet
with any sign of Christmas; perhaps it was because
I myself had nearly forgotten the holiday. Whatever
the cause, it gave me quite a turn.</p>

<p>I stood, and stared at it. It looked dry, almost
withered. Probably it had come a long way. Not
much holly grows about Printing-House Square,
except in the colored supplements, and that is
scarcely of a kind to stir tender memories. Withered
and dry, this did. I thought, with a twinge of
conscience, of secret little conclaves of my children,
of private views of things hidden from mamma at
the bottom of drawers, of wild flights when papa
appeared unbidden in the door, which I had allowed
for once to pass unheeded. Absorbed in the busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>ness
of the office, I had hardly thought of Christmas
coming on, until now it was here. And this sprig
of holly on the wall that had come to remind me,&mdash;come
nobody knew how far,&mdash;did it grow yet in
the beech-wood clearings, as it did when I gathered
it as a boy, tracking through the snow? "Christ-thorn"
we called it in our Danish tongue. The red
berries, to our simple faith, were the drops of blood
that fell from the Saviour's brow as it drooped
under its cruel crown upon the cross.</p>

<p>Back to the long ago wandered my thoughts: to
the moss-grown beech in which I cut my name and
that of a little girl with yellow curls, of blessed
memory, with the first jack-knife I ever owned; to
the story-book with the little fir tree that pined
because it was small, and because the hare jumped
over it, and would not be content though the wind
and the sun kissed it, and the dews wept over it
and told it to rejoice in its young life; and that
was so proud when, in the second year, the hare
had to go round it, because then it knew it was
getting big,&mdash;Hans Christian Andersen's story that
we loved above all the rest; for we knew the tree
right well, and the hare; even the tracks it left in
the snow we had seen. Ah, those were the Yule-tide
seasons, when the old Domkirke shone with a
thousand wax candles on Christmas eve; when all
business was laid aside to let the world make merry
one whole week; when big red apples were roasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
on the stove, and bigger doughnuts were baked
within it for the long feast! Never such had been
known since. Christmas to-day is but a name, a
memory.</p>

<p>A door slammed below, and let in the noises of
the street. The holly rustled in the draught. Some
one going out said, "A Merry Christmas to you
all!" in a big, hearty voice. I awoke from my
revery to find myself back in New York with a glad
glow at the heart. It was not true. I had only
forgotten. It was myself that had changed, not
Christmas. That was here, with the old cheer, the
old message of good-will, the old royal road to the
heart of mankind. How often had I seen its blessed
charity, that never corrupts, make light in the
hovels of darkness and despair! how often watched
its spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion in those who
had, besides themselves, nothing to give! and as
often the sight had made whole my faith in human
nature. No! Christmas was not of the past, its
spirit not dead. The lad who fixed the sprig of
holly on the stairs knew it; my reporter's note-book
bore witness to it. Witness of my contrition for
the wrong I did the gentle spirit of the holiday,
here let the book tell the story of one Christmas
in the tenements of the poor:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is evening in Grand Street. The shops east
and west are pouring forth their swarms of workers.
Street and sidewalk are filled with an eager throng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of young men and women, chatting gayly, and
elbowing the jam of holiday shoppers that linger
about the big stores. The street-cars labor along,
loaded down to the steps with passengers carrying
bundles of every size and odd shape. Along the
curb a string of pedlers hawk penny toys in push-carts
with noisy clamor, fearless for once of being
moved on by the police. Christmas brings a two
weeks' respite from persecution even to the friendless
street-fakir. From the window of one brilliantly
lighted store a bevy of mature dolls in
dishabille stretch forth their arms appealingly to
a troop of factory-hands passing by. The young
men chaff the girls, who shriek with laughter and
run. The policeman on the corner stops beating
his hands together to keep warm, and makes a mock
attempt to catch them, whereat their shrieks rise
shriller than ever. "Them stockin's o' yourn 'll be
the death o' Santa Claus!" he shouts after them, as
they dodge. And they, looking back, snap saucily,
"Mind yer business, freshy!" But their laughter
belies their words. "They giv' it to ye straight that
time," grins the grocer's clerk, come out to snatch
a look at the crowds; and the two swap holiday
greetings.</p>

<p>At the corner, where two opposing tides of travel
form an eddy, the line of push-carts debouches
down the darker side street. In its gloom their
torches burn with a fitful glare that wakes black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
shadows among the trusses of the railroad structure
overhead. A woman, with worn shawl drawn
tightly about head and shoulders, bargains with a
pedler for a monkey on a stick and two cents' worth
of flitter-gold. Five ill-clad youngsters flatten their
noses against the frozen pane of the toy-shop, in
ecstasy at something there, which proves to be a
milk wagon, with driver, horses, and cans that can
be unloaded. It is something their minds can grasp.
One comes forth with a penny goldfish of pasteboard
clutched tightly in his hand, and, casting
cautious glances right and left, speeds across the
way to the door of a tenement, where a little girl
stands waiting. "It's yer Chris'mas, Kate," he
says, and thrusts it into her eager fist. The black
doorway swallows them up.</p>

<p>Across the narrow yard, in the basement of the
rear house, the lights of a Christmas tree show
against the grimy window pane. The hare would
never have gone around it, it is so very small. The
two children are busily engaged fixing the goldfish
upon one of its branches. Three little candles that
burn there shed light upon a scene of utmost desolation.
The room is black with smoke and dirt.
In the middle of the floor oozes an oil-stove that
serves at once to take the raw edge off the cold and
to cook the meals by. Half the window panes are
broken, and the holes stuffed with rags. The sleeve
of an old coat hangs out of one, and beats drearily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
upon the sash when the wind sweeps over the fence
and rattles the rotten shutters. The family wash,
clammy and gray, hangs on a clothes-line stretched
across the room. Under it, at a table set with
cracked and empty plates, a discouraged woman
sits eying the children's show gloomily. It is evident
that she has been drinking. The peaked faces
of the little ones wear a famished look. There are
three&mdash;the third an infant, put to bed in what was
once a baby carriage. The two from the street are
pulling it around to get the tree in range. The baby
sees it, and crows with delight. The boy shakes a
branch, and the goldfish leaps and sparkles in the
candle-light.</p>

<p>"See, sister!" he pipes; "see Santa Claus!" And
they clap their hands in glee. The woman at the
table wakes out of her stupor, gazes around her, and
bursts into a fit of maudlin weeping.</p>

<p>The door falls to. Five flights up, another opens
upon a bare attic room which a patient little woman
is setting to rights. There are only three chairs, a
box, and a bedstead in the room, but they take a
deal of careful arranging. The bed hides the broken
plaster in the wall through which the wind came in;
each chair-leg stands over a rat-hole, at once to hide
it and to keep the rats out. One is left; the box is
for that. The plaster of the ceiling is held up with
pasteboard patches. I know the story of that attic.
It is one of cruel desertion. The woman's husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
is even now living in plenty with the creature for
whom he forsook her, not a dozen blocks away,
while she "keeps the home together for the childer."
She sought justice, but the lawyer demanded
a retainer; so she gave it up, and went back to her
little ones. For this room that barely keeps the
winter wind out she pays four dollars a month, and
is behind with the rent. There is scarce bread in
the house; but the spirit of Christmas has found
her attic. Against a broken wall is tacked a hemlock
branch, the leavings of the corner grocer's fitting-block;
pink string from the packing-counter
hangs on it in festoons. A tallow dip on the box
furnishes the illumination. The children sit up in
bed, and watch it with shining eyes.</p>

<p>"We're having Christmas!" they say.</p>

<p>The lights of the Bowery glow like a myriad
twinkling stars upon the ceaseless flood of humanity
that surges ever through the great highway of the
homeless. They shine upon long rows of lodging-houses,
in which hundreds of young men, cast helpless
upon the reef of the strange city, are learning
their first lessons of utter loneliness; for what desolation
is there like that of the careless crowd when
all the world rejoices? They shine upon the tempter
setting his snares there, and upon the missionary
and the Salvation Army lass, disputing his catch
with him; upon the police detective going his rounds
with coldly observant eye intent upon the outcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the contest; upon the wreck that is past hope, and
upon the youth pausing on the verge of the pit in
which the other has long ceased to struggle. Sights
and sounds of Christmas there are in plenty in
the Bowery. Balsam and hemlock and fir stand in
groves along the busy thoroughfare, and garlands
of green embower mission and dive impartially.
Once a year the old street recalls its youth with an
effort. It is true that it is largely a commercial
effort; that the evergreen, with an instinct that is
not of its native hills, haunts saloon-corners by
preference; but the smell of the pine woods is in
the air, and&mdash;Christmas is not too critical&mdash;one is
grateful for the effort. It varies with the opportunity.
At "Beefsteak John's" it is content with
artistically embalming crullers and mince-pies in
green cabbage under the window lamp. Over yonder,
where the mile-post of the old lane still stands,&mdash;in
its unhonored old age become the vehicle of
publishing the latest "sure cure" to the world,&mdash;a
florist, whose undenominational zeal for the holiday
and trade outstrips alike distinction of creed and
property, has transformed the sidewalk and the ugly
railroad structure into a veritable bower, spanning
it with a canopy of green, under which dwell with
him, in neighborly good-will, the Young Men's
Christian Association and the Jewish tailor next
door.</p>

<p>In the next block a "turkey-shoot" is in progress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Crowds are trying their luck at breaking the glass
balls that dance upon tiny jets of water in front of
a marine view with the moon rising, yellow and
big, out of a silver sea. A man-of-war, with lights
burning aloft, labors under a rocky coast. Groggy
sailormen, on shore leave, make unsteady attempts
upon the dancing balls. One mistakes the moon for
the target, but is discovered in season. "Don't shoot
that," says the man who loads the guns; "there's a
lamp behind it." Three scared birds in the window
recess try vainly to snatch a moment's sleep between
shots and the trains that go roaring overhead on the
elevated road. Roused by the sharp crack of the
rifles, they blink at the lights in the street, and peck
moodily at a crust in their bed of shavings.</p>

<p>The dime museum gong clatters out its noisy
warning that "the lecture" is about to begin. From
the concert hall, where men sit drinking beer in
clouds of smoke, comes the thin voice of a short-skirted
singer, warbling, "Do they think of me at
home?" The young fellow who sits near the door,
abstractedly making figures in the wet track of the
"schooners," buries something there with a sudden
restless turn, and calls for another beer. Out in
the street a band strikes up. A host with banners
advances, chanting an unfamiliar hymn. In the
ranks marches a cripple on crutches. Newsboys follow,
gaping. Under the illuminated clock of the
Cooper Institute the procession halts, and the leader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
turning his face to the sky, offers a prayer. The
passing crowds stop to listen. A few bare their
heads. The devoted group, the flapping banners,
and the changing torch-light on upturned faces,
make a strange, weird picture. Then the drum-beat,
and the band files into its barracks across the street.
A few of the listeners follow, among them the lad
from the concert hall, who slinks shamefacedly in
when he thinks no one is looking.</p>

<p>Down at the foot of the Bowery is the "panhandlers'
beat," where the saloons elbow one
another at every step, crowding out all other business
than that of keeping lodgers to support them.
Within call of it, across the square, stands a church
which, in the memory of men yet living, was built
to shelter the fashionable Baptist audiences of a
day when Madison Square was out in the fields,
and Harlem had a foreign sound. The fashionable
audiences are gone long since. To-day the church,
fallen into premature decay, but still handsome in
its strong and noble lines, stands as a missionary
outpost in the land of the enemy, its builders would
have said, doing a greater work than they planned.
To-night is the Christmas festival of its English-speaking
Sunday-school, and the pews are filled.
The banners of United Italy, of modern Hellas, of
France and Germany and England, hang side by
side with the Chinese dragon and the starry flag&mdash;signs
of the cosmopolitan character of the congre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>gation.
Greek and Roman Catholics, Jews and
joss-worshippers, go there; few Protestants, and no
Baptists. It is easy to pick out the children in their
seats by nationality, and as easy to read the story
of poverty and suffering that stands written in more
than one mother's haggard face, now beaming with
pleasure at the little ones' glee. A gayly decorated
Christmas tree has taken the place of the pulpit.
At its foot is stacked a mountain of bundles, Santa
Claus's gifts to the school. A self-conscious young
man with soap-locks has just been allowed to retire,
amid tumultuous applause, after blowing "Nearer,
My God, to Thee" on his horn until his cheeks
swelled almost to bursting. A trumpet ever takes
the Fourth Ward by storm. A class of little girls is
climbing upon the platform. Each wears a capital
letter on her breast, and has a piece to speak that
begins with the letter; together they spell its lesson.
There is momentary consternation; one is missing.
As the discovery is made, a child pushes past the
door-keeper, hot and breathless. "I am in 'Boundless
Love,'" she says, and makes for the platform,
where her arrival restores confidence and the language.</p>

<p>In the audience the befrocked visitor from up-town
sits cheek by jowl with the pigtailed Chinaman
and the dark-browed Italian. Up in the
gallery, farthest from the preacher's desk and the
tree, sits a Jewish mother with three boys, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in rags. A dingy and threadbare shawl partly hides
her poor calico wrap and patched apron. The
woman shrinks in the pew, fearful of being seen;
her boys stand upon the benches, and applaud with
the rest. She endeavors vainly to restrain them.
"Tick, tick!" goes the old clock over the door
through which wealth and fashion went out long
years ago, and poverty came in.</p>

<p>Tick, tick! the world moves, with us&mdash;without;
without or with. She is the yesterday, they the
to-morrow. What shall the harvest be?</p>

<p>Loudly ticked the old clock in time with the
doxology, the other day, when they cleared the
tenants out of Gotham Court down here in Cherry
Street, and shut the iron doors of Single and Double
Alley against them. Never did the world move
faster or surer toward a better day than when the
wretched slum was seized by the health officers as
a nuisance unfit longer to disgrace a Christian city.
The snow lies deep in the deserted passsageways,
and the vacant floors are given over to evil smells,
and to the rats that forage in squads, burrowing in
the neglected sewers. The "wall of wrath" still
towers above the buildings in the adjoining Alderman's
Court, but its wrath at last is wasted.</p>

<p>It was built by a vengeful Quaker, whom the
alderman had knocked down in a quarrel over the
boundary line, and transmitted its legacy of hate to
generations yet unborn; for where it stood it shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
out sunlight and air from the tenements of Alderman's
Court. And at last it is to go, Gotham
Court and all; and to the going the wall of wrath
has contributed its share, thus in the end atoning
for some of the harm it wrought. Tick! old clock;
the world moves. Never yet did Christmas seem
less dark on Cherry Hill than since the lights were
put out in Gotham Court forever.</p>

<p>In "The Bend" the philanthropist undertaker
who "buries for what he can catch on the plate"
hails the Yule-tide season with a pyramid of green
made of two coffins set on end. It has been a good
day, he says cheerfully, putting up the shutters;
and his mind is easy. But the "good days" of The
Bend are over, too. The Bend itself is all but gone.
Where the old pig-sty stood, children dance and
sing to the strumming of a cracked piano-organ
propelled on wheels by an Italian and his wife.
The park that has come to take the place of the
slum will curtail the undertaker's profits, as it has
lessened the work of the police. Murder was the
fashion of the day that is past. Scarce a knife has
been drawn since the sunlight shone into that evil
spot, and grass and green shrubs took the place of
the old rookeries. The Christmas gospel of peace
and good-will moves in where the slum moves out.
It never had a chance before.</p>

<p>The children follow the organ, stepping in the
slush to the music, bareheaded and with torn shoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
but happy; across the Five Points and through "the
Bay,"&mdash;known to the directory as Baxter Street,&mdash;to
"the Divide," still Chatham Street to its denizens,
though the aldermen have rechristened it Park
Row. There other delegations of Greek and Italian
children meet and escort the music on its homeward
trip. In one of the crooked streets near the river
its journey comes to an end. A battered door opens
to let it in. A tallow dip burns sleepily on the
creaking stairs. The water runs with a loud clatter
in the sink: it is to keep it from freezing. There
is not a whole window pane in the hall. Time was
when this was a fine house harboring wealth and
refinement. It has neither now. In the old parlor
downstairs a knot of hard-faced men and women
sit on benches about a deal table, playing cards.
They have a jug between them, from which they
drink by turns. On the stump of a mantel-shelf a
lamp burns before a rude print of the Mother of
God. No one pays any heed to the hand-organ man
and his wife as they climb to their attic. There is
a colony of them up there&mdash;three families in four
rooms.</p>

<p>"Come in, Antonio," says the tenant of the double
flat,&mdash;the one with two rooms,&mdash;"come and keep
Christmas." Antonio enters, cap in hand. In the
corner by the dormer-window a "crib" has been
fitted up in commemoration of the Nativity. A
soap-box and two hemlock branches are the ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>ments.
Six tallow candles and a night-light illuminate
a singular collection of rarities, set out with
much ceremonial show. A doll tightly wrapped in
swaddling-clothes represents "the Child." Over it
stands a ferocious-looking beast, easily recognized
as a survival of the last political campaign,&mdash;the
Tammany tiger,&mdash;threatening to swallow it at a
gulp if one as much as takes one's eyes off it. A
miniature Santa Claus, a pasteboard monkey, and
several other articles of bric-à-brac of the kind the
tenement affords, complete the outfit. The background
is a picture of St. Donato, their village saint,
with the Madonna "whom they worship most." But
the incongruity harbors no suggestion of disrespect.
The children view the strange show with genuine
reverence, bowing and crossing themselves before it.
There are five, the oldest a girl of seventeen, who
works for a sweater, making three dollars a week.
It is all the money that comes in, for the father
has been sick and unable to work eight months and
the mother has her hands full: the youngest is a
baby in arms. Three of the children go to a charity
school, where they are fed, a great help, now the
holidays have come to make work slack for sister.
The rent is six dollars&mdash;two weeks' pay out of the
four. The mention of a possible chance of light
work for the man brings the daughter with her sewing
from the adjoining room, eager to hear. That
would be Christmas indeed! "Pietro!" She runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to the neighbors to communicate the joyful tidings.
Pietro comes, with his new-born baby, which he is
tending while his wife lies ill, to look at the maestro,
so powerful and good. He also has been out of
work for months, with a family of mouths to fill,
and nothing coming in. His children are all small
yet, but they speak English.</p>

<p>"What," I say, holding a silver dime up before
the oldest, a smart little chap of seven&mdash;"what
would you do if I gave you this?"</p>

<p>"Get change," he replies promptly. When he is
told that it is his own, to buy toys with, his eyes
open wide with wondering incredulity. By degrees
he understands. The father does not. He looks
questioningly from one to the other. When told,
his respect increases visibly for "the rich gentleman."</p>

<p>They were villagers of the same community in
southern Italy, these people and others in the tenements
thereabouts, and they moved their patron
saint with them. They cluster about his worship
here, but the worship is more than an empty form.
He typifies to them the old neighborliness of home,
the spirit of mutual help, of charity, and of the
common cause against the common enemy. The
community life survives through their saint in the
far city to an unsuspected extent. The sick are
cared for; the dreaded hospital is fenced out. There
are no Italian evictions. The saint has paid the rent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of this attic through two hard months; and here at
his shrine the Calabrian village gathers, in the persons
of these three, to do him honor on Christmas
eve.</p>

<p>Where the old Africa has been made over into a
modern Italy, since King Humbert's cohorts struck
the up-town trail, three hundred of the little foreigners
are having an uproarious time over their
Christmas tree in the Children's Aid Society's
school. And well they may, for the like has not
been seen in Sullivan Street in this generation.
Christmas trees are rather rarer over here than on
the East Side, where the German leavens the lump
with his loyalty to home traditions. This is loaded
with silver and gold and toys without end, until
there is little left of the original green. Santa
Claus's sleigh must have been upset in a snow-drift
over here, and righted by throwing the cargo overboard,
for there is at least a wagon-load of things
that can find no room on the tree. The appearance
of "teacher" with a double armful of curly-headed
dolls in red, yellow, and green Mother-Hubbards,
doubtful how to dispose of them, provokes a shout
of approval, which is presently quieted by the principal's
bell. School is "in" for the preliminary
exercises. Afterward there are to be the tree and
ice-cream for the good children. In their anxiety
to prove their title clear, they sit so straight, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
arms folded, that the whole row bends over backward.
The lesson is brief, the answers to the point.</p>

<p>"What do we receive at Christmas?" the teacher
wants to know. The whole school responds with a
shout, "Dolls and toys!" To the question, "Why
do we receive them at Christmas?" the answer is
not so prompt. But one youngster from Thompson
Street holds up his hand. He knows. "Because
we always get 'em," he says; and the class is convinced:
it is a fact. A baby wails because it cannot
get the whole tree at once. The "little mother"&mdash;herself
a child of less than a dozen winters&mdash;who
has it in charge, cooes over it, and soothes its grief
with the aid of a surreptitious sponge-cake evolved
from the depths of teacher's pocket. Babies are
encouraged in these schools, though not originally
included in their plan, as often the one condition
upon which the older children can be reached. Some
one has to mind the baby, with all hands out at
work.</p>

<p>The school sings "Santa Lucia" and "Children
of the Heavenly King," and baby is lulled to sleep.</p>

<p>"Who is this King?" asks the teacher, suddenly,
at the end of a verse. Momentary stupefaction.
The little minds are on ice-cream just then; the lad
nearest the door has telegraphed that it is being
carried up in pails. A little fellow on the back seat
saves the day. Up goes his brown fist.</p>

<p>"Well, Vito, who is he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"McKinley!" pipes the lad, who remembers the
election just past; and the school adjourns for ice-cream.</p>

<p>It is a sight to see them eat it. In a score of
such schools, from the Hook to Harlem, the sight is
enjoyed in Christmas week by the men and women
who, out of their own pockets, reimburse Santa
Claus for his outlay, and count it a joy, as well they
may; for their beneficence sometimes makes the one
bright spot in lives that have suffered of all wrongs
the most cruel,&mdash;that of being despoiled of their
childhood. Sometimes they are little Bohemians;
sometimes the children of refugee Jews; and again,
Italians, or the descendants of the Irish stock of
Hell's Kitchen and Poverty Row; always the poorest,
the shabbiest, the hungriest&mdash;the children Santa
Claus loves best to find, if any one will show him
the way. Having so much on hand, he has no time,
you see, to look them up himself. That must be
done for him; and it is done. To the teacher in the
Sullivan Street school came one little girl, this last
Christmas, with anxious inquiry if it was true that
he came around with toys.</p>

<p>"I hanged my stocking last time," she said, "and
he didn't come at all." In the front house indeed,
he left a drum and a doll, but no message from him
reached the rear house in the alley. "Maybe he
couldn't find it," she said soberly. Did the teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
think he would come if she wrote to him? She had
learned to write.</p>

<p>Together they composed a note to Santa Claus,
speaking for a doll and a bell&mdash;the bell to play
"go to school" with when she was kept home minding
the baby. Lest he should by any chance miss
the alley in spite of directions, little Rosa was invited
to hang her stocking, and her sister's, with
the janitor's children's in the school. And lo! on
Christmas morning there was a gorgeous doll, and a
bell that was a whole curriculum in itself, as good
as a year's schooling any day! Faith in Santa Claus
is established in that Thompson Street alley for this
generation at least; and Santa Claus, got by hook
or by crook into an Eighth Ward alley, is as good
as the whole Supreme Court bench, with the Court
of Appeals thrown in, for backing the Board of
Health against the slum.</p>

<p>But the ice-cream! They eat it off the seats, half
of them kneeling or squatting on the floor; they
blow on it, and put it in their pockets to carry home
to baby. Two little shavers discovered to be feeding
each other, each watching the smack develop on
the other's lips as the acme of his own bliss, are
"cousins"; that is why. Of cake there is a double
supply. It is a dozen years since "Fighting Mary,"
the wildest child in the Seventh Avenue school,
taught them a lesson there which they have never
forgotten. She was perfectly untamable, fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
everybody in school, the despair of her teacher, till
on Thanksgiving, reluctantly included in the general
amnesty and mince-pie, she was caught cramming
the pie into her pocket, after eyeing it with a
look of pure ecstasy, but refusing to touch it. "For
mother" was her explanation, delivered with a defiant
look before which the class quailed. It is
recorded, but not in the minutes, that the board
of managers wept over Fighting Mary, who, all
unconscious of having caused such an astonishing
"break," was at that moment engaged in maintaining
her prestige and reputation by fighting the gang
in the next block. The minutes contain merely a
formal resolution to the effect that occasions of
mince-pie shall carry double rations thenceforth.
And the rule has been kept&mdash;not only in Seventh
Avenue, but in every industrial school&mdash;since.
Fighting Mary won the biggest fight of her troubled
life that day, without striking a blow.</p>

<p>It was in the Seventh Avenue school last Christmas
that I offered the truant class a four-bladed
penknife as a prize for whittling out the truest
Maltese cross. It was a class of black sheep, and
it was the blackest sheep of the flock that won the
prize. "That awful Savarese," said the principal
in despair. I thought of Fighting Mary, and bade
her take heart. I regret to say that within a week
the hapless Savarese was black-listed for banking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
up the school door with snow, so that not even the
janitor could get out and at him.</p>

<p>Within hail of the Sullivan Street school camps
a scattered little band, the Christmas customs of
which I had been trying for years to surprise. They
are Indians, a handful of Mohawks and Iroquois,
whom some ill wind has blown down from their
Canadian reservation, and left in these West Side
tenements to eke out such a living as they can,
weaving mats and baskets, and threading glass
pearls on slippers and pin-cushions, until, one after
another, they have died off and gone to happier
hunting-grounds than Thompson Street. There
were as many families as one could count on the
fingers of both hands when I first came upon them,
at the death of old Tamenund, the basket maker.
Last Christmas there were seven. I had about made
up my mind that the only real Americans in New
York did not keep the holiday at all, when, one
Christmas eve, they showed me how. Just as dark
was setting in, old Mrs. Benoit came from her Hudson
Street attic&mdash;where she was known among the
neighbors, as old and poor as she, as Mrs. Ben Wah,
and was believed to be the relict of a warrior of
the name of Benjamin Wah&mdash;to the office of the
Charity Organization Society, with a bundle for a
friend who had helped her over a rough spot&mdash;the
rent, I suppose. The bundle was done up elaborately
in blue cheese-cloth, and contained a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
little garments which she had made out of the remnants
of blankets and cloth of her own from a
younger and better day. "For those," she said, in
her French patois, "who are poorer than myself;"
and hobbled away. I found out, a few days later,
when I took her picture weaving mats in her attic
room, that she had scarcely food in the house that
Christmas day and not the car fare to take her to
church! Walking was bad, and her old limbs were
stiff. She sat by the window through the winter
evening, and watched the sun go down behind the
western hills, comforted by her pipe. Mrs. Ben
Wah, to give her her local name, is not really an
Indian; but her husband was one, and she lived
all her life with the tribe till she came here. She
is a philosopher in her own quaint way. "It is no
disgrace to be poor," said she to me, regarding her
empty tobacco-pouch; "but it is sometimes a great
inconvenience." Not even the recollection of the
vote of censure that was passed upon me once by
the ladies of the Charitable Ten for surreptitiously
supplying an aged couple, the special object of their
charity, with army plug, could have deterred me
from taking the hint.</p>

<p>Very likely, my old friend Miss Sherman, in her
Broome Street cellar,&mdash;it is always the attic or the
cellar,&mdash;would object to Mrs. Ben Wah's claim to
being the only real American in my note-book. She
is from Down East, and says "stun" for stone. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
her youth she was lady's-maid to a general's wife,
the recollection of which military career equally
condones the cellar and prevents her holding any
sort of communication with her common neighbors,
who add to the offence of being foreigners the unpardonable
one of being mostly men. Eight cats
bear her steady company, and keep alive her starved
affections. I found them on last Christmas eve
behind barricaded doors; for the cold that had
locked the water-pipes had brought the neighbors
down to the cellar, where Miss Sherman's cunning
had kept them from freezing. Their tin pans and
buckets were even then banging against her door.
"They're a miserable lot," said the old maid, fondling
her cats defiantly; "but let 'em. It's Christmas.
Ah!" she added, as one of the eight stood
up in her lap and rubbed its cheek against hers,
"they're innocent. It isn't poor little animals that
does the harm. It's men and women that does it
to each other." I don't know whether it was just
philosophy, like Mrs. Ben Wah's, or a glimpse of
her story. If she had one, she kept it for her cats.</p>

<p>In a hundred places all over the city, when
Christmas comes, as many open-air fairs spring
suddenly into life. A kind of Gentile Feast of
Tabernacles possesses the tenement districts especially.
Green-embowered booths stand in rows at
the curb, and the voice of the tin trumpet is heard
in the land. The common source of all the show is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
down by the North River, in the district known as
"the Farm." Down there Santa Claus establishes
headquarters early in December and until past New
Year. The broad quay looks then more like a clearing
in a pine forest than a busy section of the
metropolis. The steamers discharge their loads of
fir trees at the piers until they stand stacked mountain-high,
with foot-hills of holly and ground-ivy
trailing off toward the land side. An army train
of wagons is engaged in carting them away from
early morning till late at night; but the green forest
grows, in spite of it all, until in places it shuts the
shipping out of sight altogether. The air is redolent
with the smell of balsam and pine. After
nightfall, when the lights are burning in the busy
market, and the homeward-bound crowds with baskets
and heavy burdens of Christmas greens jostle
one another with good-natured banter,&mdash;nobody is
ever cross down here in the holiday season,&mdash;it is
good to take a stroll through the Farm, if one has
a spot in his heart faithful yet to the hills and the
woods in spite of the latter-day city. But it is
when the moonlight is upon the water and upon the
dark phantom forest, when the heavy breathing of
some passing steamer is the only sound that breaks
the stillness of the night, and the watchman smokes
his only pipe on the bulwark, that the Farm has a
mood and an atmosphere all its own, full of poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
which some day a painter's brush will catch and
hold.</p>

<p>Into the ugliest tenement street Christmas brings
something of picturesqueness, of cheer. Its message
was ever to the poor and the heavy-laden, and by
them it is understood with an instinctive yearning
to do it honor. In the stiff dignity of the brown-stone
streets up-town there may be scarce a hint of
it. In the homes of the poor it blossoms on stoop
and fire-escape, looks out of the front window, and
makes the unsightly barber-pole to sprout overnight
like an Aaron's-rod. Poor indeed is the home that
has not its sign of peace over the hearth, be it but
a single sprig of green. A little color creeps with
it even into rabbinical Hester Street, and shows in
the shop-windows and in the children's faces. The
very feather dusters in the pedler's stock take on
brighter hues for the occasion, and the big knives in
the cutler's shop gleam with a lively anticipation of
the impending goose "with fixin's"&mdash;a concession,
perhaps, to the commercial rather than the religious
holiday: business comes then, if ever. A crowd of
ragamuffins camp out at a window where Santa
Claus and his wife stand in state, embodiment of
the domestic ideal that has not yet gone out of
fashion in these tenements, gazing hungrily at the
announcement that "A silver present will be given
to every purchaser by a real Santa Claus.&mdash;M. Levitsky."
Across the way, in a hole in the wall, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
cobblers are pegging away under an oozy lamp that
makes a yellow splurge on the inky blackness about
them, revealing to the passer-by their bearded faces,
but nothing of the environment save a single sprig
of holly suspended from the lamp. From what forgotten
brake it came with a message of cheer, a
thought of wife and children across the sea waiting
their summons, God knows. The shop is their house
and home. It was once the hall of the tenement;
but to save space, enough has been walled in to
make room for their bench and bed; the tenants
go through the next house. No matter if they are
cramped; by and by they will have room. By and
by comes the spring, and with it the steamer. Does
not the green branch speak of spring and of hope?
The policeman on the beat hears their hammers beat
a joyous tattoo past midnight, far into Christmas
morning. Who shall say its message has not
reached even them in their slum?</p>

<p>Where the noisy trains speed over the iron highway
past the second-story windows of Allen Street,
a cellar door yawns darkly in the shadow of one of
the pillars that half block the narrow sidewalk. A
dull gleam behind the cobweb-shrouded window
pane supplements the sign over the door, in Yiddish
and English: "Old Brasses." Four crooked and
mouldy steps lead to utter darkness, with no
friendly voice to guide the hapless customer. Fumbling
along the dank wall, he is left to find the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of the shop as best he can. Not a likely place to
encounter the fastidious from the Avenue! Yet
ladies in furs and silk find this door and the grim
old smith within it. Now and then an artist stumbles
upon them, and exults exceedingly in his find.
Two holiday shoppers are even now haggling with
the coppersmith over the price of a pair of curiously
wrought brass candlesticks. The old man has
turned from the forge, at which he was working,
unmindful of his callers roving among the dusty
shelves. Standing there, erect and sturdy, in his
shiny leather apron, hammer in hand, with the firelight
upon his venerable head, strong arms bared to
the elbow, and the square paper cap pushed back
from a thoughtful, knotty brow, he stirs strange
fancies. One half expects to see him fashioning a
gorget or a sword on his anvil. But his is a more
peaceful craft. Nothing more warlike is in sight
than a row of brass shields, destined for ornament,
not for battle. Dark shadows chase one another by
the flickering light among copper kettles of ruddy
glow, old-fashioned samovars, and massive andirons
of tarnished brass. The bargaining goes on. Overhead
the nineteenth century speeds by with rattle
and roar; in here linger the shadows of the centuries
long dead. The boy at the anvil listens open-mouthed,
clutching the bellows-rope.</p>

<p>In Liberty Hall a Jewish wedding is in progress.
Liberty! Strange how the word echoes through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
these sweaters' tenements, where starvation is at
home half the time. It is an all-consuming passion
with these people, whose spirit a thousand years of
bondage have not availed to daunt. It breaks out
in strikes, when to strike is to hunger and die. Not
until I stood by a striking cloak-maker whose last
cent was gone, with not a crust in the house to
feed seven hungry mouths, yet who had voted vehemently
in the meeting that day to keep up the strike
to the bitter end,&mdash;bitter indeed, nor far distant,&mdash;and
heard him at sunset recite the prayer of his
fathers: "Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King
of the world, that thou hast redeemed us as thou
didst redeem our fathers, hast delivered us from
bondage to liberty, and from servile dependence to
redemption!"&mdash;not until then did I know what of
sacrifice the word might mean, and how utterly we
of another day had forgotten. But for once shop
and tenement are left behind. Whatever other days
may have in store, this is their day of play, when
all may rejoice.</p>

<p>The bridegroom, a cloak-presser in a hired dress
suit, sits alone and ill at ease at one end of the hall,
sipping whiskey with a fine air of indifference,
but glancing apprehensively toward the crowd of
women in the opposite corner that surround the
bride, a pale little shop-girl with a pleading, winsome
face. From somewhere unexpectedly appears
a big man in an ill-fitting coat and skullcap, flanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
on either side by a fiddler, who scrapes away and
away, accompanying the improvisator in a plaintive
minor key as he halts before the bride and intones
his lay. With many a shrug of stooping shoulders
and queer excited gesture, he drones, in the harsh,
guttural Yiddish of Hester Street, his story of life's
joys and sorrows, its struggles and victories in the
land of promise. The women listen, nodding and
swaying their bodies sympathetically. He works
himself into a frenzy, in which the fiddlers vainly
try to keep up with him. He turns and digs the
laggard angrily in the side without losing the metre.
The climax comes. The bride bursts into hysterical
sobs, while the women wipe their eyes. A plate,
heretofore concealed under his coat, is whisked
out. He has conquered; the inevitable collection
is taken up.</p>

<p>The tuneful procession moves upon the bridegroom.
An Essex Street girl in the crowd, watching
them go, says disdainfully: "None of this humbug
when I get married." It is the straining of young
America at the fetters of tradition. Ten minutes
later, when, between double files of women holding
candles, the couple pass to the canopy where the
rabbi waits, she has already forgotten; and when
the crunching of a glass under the bridegroom's heel
announces that they are one, and that until the
broken pieces be reunited he is hers and hers alone,
she joins with all the company in the exulting shout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of "Mozzel tov!" ("Good luck!"). Then the
<i>dupka</i>, men and women joining in, forgetting all
but the moment, hands on hips, stepping in time,
forward, backward, and across. And then the feast.</p>

<p>They sit at the long tables by squads and tribes.
Those who belong together sit together. There is
no attempt at pairing off for conversation or mutual
entertainment, at speech-making or toasting. The
business in hand is to eat, and it is attended to.
The bridegroom, at the head of the table, with his
shiny silk hat on, sets the example; and the guests
emulate it with zeal, the men smoking big, strong
cigars between mouthfuls. "Gosh! ain't it fine?"
is the grateful comment of one curly-headed
youngster, bravely attacking his third plate of
chicken-stew. "Fine as silk," nods his neighbor in
knickerbockers. Christmas, for once, means something
to them that they can understand. The crowd
of hurrying waiters make room for one bearing aloft
a small turkey adorned with much tinsel and many
paper flowers. It is for the bride, the one thing not
to be touched until the next day&mdash;one day off from
the drudgery of housekeeping; she, too, can keep
Christmas.</p>

<p>A group of bearded, dark-browed men sit apart,
the rabbi among them. They are the orthodox, who
cannot break bread with the rest, for fear, though
the food be kosher, the plates have been defiled.
They brought their own to the feast, and sit at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
own table, stern and justified. Did they but know
what depravity is harbored in the impish mind of
the girl yonder, who plans to hang her stocking
overnight by the window! There is no fireplace in
the tenement. Queer things happen over here, in
the strife between the old and the new. The girls
of the College Settlement, last summer, felt compelled
to explain that the holiday in the country
which they offered some of these children was to
be spent in an Episcopal clergyman's house, where
they had prayers every morning. "Oh," was the
mother's indulgent answer, "they know it isn't true,
so it won't hurt them."</p>

<p>The bell of a neighboring church tower strikes the
vesper hour. A man in working-clothes uncovers
his head reverently, and passes on. Through the
vista of green bowers formed of the grocer's stock
of Christmas trees a passing glimpse of flaring
torches in the distant square is caught. They touch
with flame the gilt cross towering high above the
"White Garden," as the German residents call
Tompkins Square. On the sidewalk the holy-eve
fair is in its busiest hour. In the pine-board booths
stand rows of staring toy dogs alternately with
plaster saints. Red apples and candy are hawked
from carts. Pedlers offer colored candles with shrill
outcry. A huckster feeding his horse by the curb
scatters, unseen, a share for the sparrows. The cross
flashes white against the dark sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of the side streets near the East River has
stood for thirty years a little mission church, called
Hope Chapel by its founders, in the brave spirit in
which they built it. It has had plenty of use for
the spirit since. Of the kind of problems that beset
its pastor I caught a glimpse the other day, when,
as I entered his room, a rough-looking man went
out.</p>

<p>"One of my cares," said Mr. Devins, looking
after him with contracted brow. "He has spent
two Christmas days of twenty-three out of jail.
He is a burglar, or was. His daughter has brought
him round. She is a seamstress. For three months,
now, she has been keeping him and the home, working
nights. If I could only get him a job! He
won't stay honest long without it; but who wants
a burglar for a watchman? And how can I recommend
him?"</p>

<p>A few doors from the chapel an alley sets into
the block. We halted at the mouth of it.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Mr. Devins, "and wish Blind
Jennie a Merry Christmas."</p>

<p>We went in, in single file; there was not room
for two. As we climbed the creaking stairs of the
rear tenement, a chorus of children's shrill voices
burst into song somewhere above.</p>

<p>"It is her class," said the pastor of Hope Chapel,
as he stopped on the landing. "They are all kinds.
We never could hope to reach them; Jennie can.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
They fetch her the papers given out in the Sunday-school,
and read to her what is printed under the
pictures; and she tells them the story of it. There
is nothing Jennie doesn't know about the Bible."</p>

<p>The door opened upon a low-ceiled room, where
the evening shades lay deep. The red glow from
the kitchen stove discovered a jam of children,
young girls mostly, perched on the table, the chairs,
in one another's laps, or squatting on the floor; in
the midst of them, a little old woman with heavily
veiled face, and wan, wrinkled hands folded in her
lap. The singing ceased as we stepped across the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Be welcome," piped a harsh voice with a singular
note of cheerfulness in it. "Whose step is that
with you, pastor? I don't know it. He is welcome
in Jennie's house, whoever he be. Girls, make him
to home." The girls moved up to make room.</p>

<p>"Jennie has not seen since she was a child," said
the clergyman, gently; "but she knows a friend
without it. Some day she shall see the great Friend
in his glory, and then she shall be Blind Jennie no
more."</p>

<p>The little woman raised the veil from a face
shockingly disfigured, and touched the eyeless
sockets. "Some day," she repeated, "Jennie shall
see. Not long now&mdash;not long!" Her pastor patted
her hand. The silence of the dark room was broken
by Blind Jennie's voice, rising cracked and quaver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>ing:
"Alas! and did my Saviour bleed?" The shrill
chorus burst in:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">It was there by faith I received my sight,</div>
<div class="line i1">And now I am happy all the day.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The light that falls from the windows of the
Neighborhood Guild, in Delancey Street, makes a
white path across the asphalt pavement. Within,
there is mirth and laughter. The Tenth Ward
Social Reform Club is having its Christmas festival.
Its members, poor mothers, scrub-women,&mdash;the
president is the janitress of a tenement near by,&mdash;have
brought their little ones, a few their husbands,
to share in the fun. One little girl has to be
dragged up to the grab-bag. She cries at the sight
of Santa Claus. The baby has drawn a woolly
horse. He kisses the toy with a look of ecstatic
bliss, and toddles away. At the far end of the hall
a game of blindman's-buff is starting up. The aged
grandmother, who has watched it with growing excitement,
bids one of the settlement workers hold
her grandchild, that she may join in; and she does
join in, with all the pent-up hunger of fifty joyless
years. The worker, looking on, smiles; one has been
reached. Thus is the battle against the slum waged
and won with the child's play.</p>

<p>Tramp! tramp! comes the to-morrow upon the
stage. Two hundred and fifty pairs of little feet,
keeping step, are marching to dinner in the Newsboys'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Lodging-house. Five hundred pairs more are
restlessly awaiting their turn upstairs. In prison,
hospital, and almshouse to-night the city is host,
and gives of her plenty. Here an unknown friend
has spread a generous repast for the waifs who all
the rest of the days shift for themselves as best they
can. Turkey, coffee, and pie, with "vegetubles" to
fill in. As the file of eagle-eyed youngsters passes
down the long tables, there are swift movements of
grimy hands, and shirt-waists bulge, ragged coats
sag at the pockets. Hardly is the file seated when
the plaint rises: "I ain't got no pie! It got swiped
on me." Seven despoiled ones hold up their hands.</p>

<p>The superintendent laughs&mdash;it is Christmas eve.
He taps one tentatively on the bulging shirt.
"What have you here, my lad?"</p>

<p>"Me pie," responds he, with an innocent look;
"I wuz scart it would get stole."</p>

<p>A little fellow who has been eying one of the
visitors attentively takes his knife out of his mouth,
and points it at him with conviction.</p>

<p>"I know you," he pipes. "You're a p'lice commissioner.
I seen yer picter in the papers. You're
Teddy Roosevelt!"</p>

<p>The clatter of knives and forks ceases suddenly.
Seven pies creep stealthily over the edge of the
table, and are replaced on as many plates. The
visitors laugh. It was a case of mistaken identity.</p>

<p>Farthest down town, where the island narrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
toward the Battery, and warehouses crowd the few
remaining tenements, the sombre-hued colony of
Syrians is astir with preparation for the holiday.
How comes it that in the only settlement of the real
Christmas people in New York the corner saloon
appropriates to itself all the outward signs of it?
Even the floral cross that is nailed over the door of
the Orthodox church is long withered and dead;
it has been there since Easter, and it is yet twelve
days to Christmas by the belated reckoning of the
Greek Church. But if the houses show no sign of
the holiday, within there is nothing lacking. The
whole colony is gone a-visiting. There are enough
of the unorthodox to set the fashion, and the rest
follow the custom of the country. The men go
from house to house, shake hands, and kiss one
another on both cheeks, with the salutation, "Kol
am va antom Salimoon." "Every year and you are
safe," the Syrian guide renders it into English; and
a non-professional interpreter amends it: "May you
grow happier year by year." Arrack made from
grapes and flavored with aniseseed, and candy baked
in little white balls like marbles, are served with the
indispensable cigarette; for long callers, the pipe.</p>

<p>In a top-floor room of one of the darkest of the
dilapidated tenements, the dusty window panes of
which the last glow in the winter sky is tinging
faintly with red, a dance is in progress. The guests,
most of them fresh from the hillsides of Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Lebanon, squat about the room. A reed-pipe and a
tambourine furnish the music. One has the centre
of the floor. With a beer jug filled to the brim on
his head, he skips and sways, bending, twisting,
kneeling, gesturing, and keeping time, while the
men clap their hands. He lies down and turns over,
but not a drop is spilled. Another succeeds him,
stepping proudly, gracefully, furling and unfurling
a handkerchief like a banner. As he sits down, and
the beer goes around, one in the corner, who looks
like a shepherd fresh from his pasture, strikes up a
song&mdash;a far-off, lonesome, plaintive lay. "'Far as
the hills,'" says the guide; "a song of the old days
and the old people, now seldom heard." All together
croon the refrain. The host delivers himself
of an epic about his love across the seas, with the
most agonizing expression, and in a shockingly bad
voice. He is the worst singer I ever heard; but his
companions greet his effort with approving shouts
of "Yi! yi!" They look so fierce, and yet are so
childishly happy, that at the thought of their exile
and of the dark tenement the question arises, "Why
all this joy?" The guide answers it with a look
of surprise. "They sing," he says, "because they
are glad they are free. Did you not know?"</p>

<p>The bells in old Trinity chime the midnight hour.
From dark hallways men and women pour forth
and hasten to the Maronite church. In the loft of
the dingy old warehouse wax candles burn before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
an altar of brass. The priest, in a white robe with
a huge gold cross worked on the back, chants the
ritual. The people respond. The women kneel in
the aisles, shrouding their heads in their shawls; a
surpliced acolyte swings his censer; the heavy perfume
of burning incense fills the hall.</p>

<p>The band at the anarchists' ball is tuning up for
the last dance. Young and old float to the happy
strains, forgetting injustice, oppression, hatred.
Children slide upon the waxed floor, weaving fearlessly
in and out between the couples&mdash;between
fierce, bearded men and short-haired women with
crimson-bordered kerchiefs. A Punch-and-Judy
show in the corner evokes shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>Outside the snow is falling. It sifts silently into
each nook and corner, softens all the hard and ugly
lines, and throws the spotless mantle of charity over
the blemishes, the shortcomings. Christmas morning
will dawn pure and white.</p>

<h2 id="TENEMENTS2">WHAT THE CHRISTMAS SUN SAW IN THE TENEMENTS</h2></div>


<p>The December sun shone clear and cold upon the
city. It shone upon rich and poor alike. It shone
into the homes of the wealthy on the avenues and
in the up-town streets, and into courts and alleys
hedged in by towering tenements down town. It
shone upon throngs of busy holiday shoppers that
went out and in at the big stores, carrying bundles
big and small, all alike filled with Christmas cheer
and kindly messages from Santa Claus.</p>

<p>It shone down so gayly and altogether cheerily
there, that wraps and overcoats were unbuttoned
for the north wind to toy with. "My, isn't it a
nice day?" said one young lady in a fur shoulder
cape to a friend, pausing to kiss and compare lists
of Christmas gifts.</p>

<p>"Most too hot," was the reply, and the friends
passed on. There was warmth within and without.
Life was very pleasant under the Christmas sun up
on the avenue.</p>

<p>Down in Cherry Street the rays of the sun
climbed over a row of tall tenements with an effort
that seemed to exhaust all the life that was in them,
and fell into a dirty block, half choked with trucks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with ash barrels and rubbish of all sorts, among
which the dust was whirled in clouds upon fitful,
shivering blasts that searched every nook and cranny
of the big barracks. They fell upon a little girl,
barefooted and in rags, who struggled out of an
alley with a broken pitcher in her grimy fist, against
the wind that set down the narrow slit like the
draught through a big factory chimney. Just at the
mouth of the alley it took her with a sudden whirl,
a cyclone of dust and drifting ashes, tossed her
fairly off her feet, tore from her grip the threadbare
shawl she clutched at her throat, and set her down
at the saloon door breathless and half smothered.
She had just time to dodge through the storm-doors
before another whirlwind swept whistling down the
street.</p>

<p>"My, but isn't it cold?" she said, as she shook
the dust out of her shawl and set the pitcher down
on the bar. "Gimme a pint," laying down a few
pennies that had been wrapped in a corner of the
shawl, "and mamma says make it good and full."</p>

<p>"All'us the way with youse kids&mdash;want a barrel
when yees pays fer a pint," growled the bartender.
"There, run along, and don't ye hang around that
stove no more. We ain't a steam-heatin' the block
fer nothin'."</p>

<p>The little girl clutched her shawl and the pitcher,
and slipped out into the street where the wind lay
in ambush and promptly bore down on her in pillars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of whirling dust as soon as she appeared. But the
sun that pitied her bare feet and little frozen hands
played a trick on old Boreas&mdash;it showed her a way
between the pillars, and only just her skirt was
caught by one and whirled over her head as she
dodged into her alley. It peeped after her halfway
down its dark depths, where it seemed colder even
than in the bleak street, but there it had to leave
her.</p>

<p>It did not see her dive through the doorless opening
into a hall where no sun-ray had ever entered.
It could not have found its way in there had it tried.
But up the narrow, squeaking stairs the girl with
the pitcher was climbing. Up one flight of stairs,
over a knot of children, half babies, pitching pennies
on the landing, over wash-tubs and bedsteads
that encumbered the next&mdash;house-cleaning going on
in that "flat"; that is to say, the surplus of bugs
was being turned out with petroleum and a feather&mdash;up
still another, past a half-open door through
which came the noise of brawling and curses. She
dodged and quickened her step a little until she
stood panting before a door on the fourth landing
that opened readily as she pushed it with her bare
foot.</p>

<p>A room almost devoid of stick or rag one might
dignify with the name of furniture. Two chairs,
one with a broken back, the other on three legs,
beside a rickety table that stood upright only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
leaning against the wall. On the unwashed floor
a heap of straw covered with dirty bedtick for a
bed; a foul-smelling slop-pail in the middle of the
room; a crazy stove, and back of it a door or gap
opening upon darkness. There was something in
there, but what it was could only be surmised from
a heavy snore that rose and fell regularly. It was
the bedroom of the apartment, windowless, airless,
and sunless, but rented at a price a millionaire
would denounce as robbery.</p>

<p>"That you, Liza?" said a voice that discovered
a woman bending over the stove. "Run 'n' get the
childer. Dinner's ready."</p>

<p>The winter sun glancing down the wall of the
opposite tenement, with a hopeless effort to cheer
the back yard, might have peeped through the one
window of the room in Mrs. McGroarty's "flat,"
had that window not been coated with the dust of
ages, and discovered that dinner party in action. It
might have found a score like it in the alley. Four
unkempt children, copies each in his or her way of
Liza and their mother, Mrs. McGroarty, who "did
washing" for a living. A meat bone, a "cut" from
the butcher's at four cents a pound, green pickles,
stale bread and beer. Beer for the four, a sup all
round, the baby included. Why not? It was the
one relish the searching ray would have found there.
Potatoes were there, too&mdash;potatoes and meat! Say
not the poor in the tenements are starving. In New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
York only those starve who cannot get work and
have not the courage to beg. Fifty thousand always
out of a job, say those who pretend to know. A
round half-million asking and getting charity in
eight years, say the statisticians of the Charity
Organization. Any one can go round and see for
himself that no one need starve in New York.</p>

<p>From across the yard the sunbeam, as it crept up
the wall, fell slantingly through the attic window
whence issued the sound of hammer-blows. A man
with a hard face stood in its light, driving nails
into the lid of a soap box that was partly filled with
straw. Something else was there; as he shifted the
lid that didn't fit, the glimpse of sunshine fell across
it; it was a dead child, a little baby in a white slip,
bedded in straw in a soap box for a coffin. The
man was hammering down the lid to take it to the
Potter's Field. At the bed knelt the mother, dry-eyed,
delirious from starvation that had killed her
child. Five hungry, frightened children cowered
in the corner, hardly daring to whisper as they
looked from the father to the mother in terror.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door that was drowned
once, twice, in the noise of the hammer on the little
coffin. Then it was opened gently, and a young
woman came in with a basket. A little silver cross
shone upon her breast. She went to the poor mother,
and, putting her hand soothingly on her head, knelt
by her with gentle and loving words. The half-crazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
woman listened with averted face, then suddenly
burst into tears and hid her throbbing head
in the other's lap.</p>

<p>The man stopped hammering and stared fixedly
upon the two; the children gathered around with
devouring looks as the visitor took from her basket
bread, meat, and tea. Just then, with a parting
wistful look into the bare attic room, the sun-ray
slipped away, lingered for a moment about the
coping outside, and fled over the housetops.</p>

<p>As it sped on its winter-day journey, did it shine
into any cabin in an Irish bog more desolate than
these Cherry Street "homes"? An army of thousands,
whose one bright and wholesome memory,
only tradition of home, is that poverty-stricken
cabin in the desolate bog, are herded in such barracks
to-day in New York. Potatoes they have;
yes, and meat at four cents&mdash;even seven. Beer for
a relish&mdash;never without beer. But home? The
home that was home, even in a bog, with the love
of it that has made Ireland immortal and a tower
of strength in the midst of her suffering&mdash;what of
that? There are no homes in New York's poor
tenements.</p>

<p>Down the crooked path of the Mulberry Street
Bend the sunlight slanted into the heart of New
York's Italy. It shone upon bandannas and yellow
neckerchiefs; upon swarthy faces and corduroy
breeches; upon black-haired girls&mdash;mothers at thir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>teen;
upon hosts of bow-legged children rolling in
the dirt; upon pedlers' carts and rag-pickers staggering
under burdens that threatened to crush them
at every step. Shone upon unnumbered Pasquales
dwelling, working, idling, and gambling there.
Shone upon the filthiest and foulest of New York's
tenements, upon Bandits' Roost, upon Bottle Alley,
upon the hidden byways that lead to the tramps'
burrows. Shone upon the scene of annual infant
slaughter. Shone into the foul core of New York's
slums that was at last to go to the realm of bad
memories because civilized man might not look
upon it and live without blushing.</p>

<p>It glanced past the rag-shop in the cellar, whence
welled up stenches to poison the town, into an
apartment three flights up that held two women,
one young, the other old and bent. The young one
had a baby at her breast. She was rocking it tenderly
in her arms, singing in the soft Italian tongue
a lullaby, while the old granny listened eagerly, her
elbows on her knees, and a stumpy clay pipe, blackened
with age, between her teeth. Her eyes were
set on the wall, on which the musty paper hung in
tatters, fit frame for the wretched, poverty-stricken
room, but they saw neither poverty nor want; her
aged limbs felt not the cold draught from without,
in which they shivered; she looked far over the
seas to sunny Italy, whose music was in her ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"O dolce Napoli," she mumbled between her
toothless jaws, "O suol beato&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The song ended in a burst of passionate grief.
The old granny and the baby woke up at once.
They were not in sunny Italy; not under southern,
cloudless skies. They were in "The Bend," in Mulberry
Street, and the wintry wind rattled the door
as if it would say, in the language of their new
home, the land of the free: "Less music! More
work! Root, hog, or die!"</p>

<p>Around the corner the sunbeam danced with the
wind into Mott Street, lifted the blouse of a Chinaman
and made it play tag with his pigtail. It used
him so roughly that he was glad to skip from it
down a cellar-way that gave out fumes of opium
strong enough to scare even the north wind from
its purpose. The soles of his felt shoes showed as
he disappeared down the ladder that passed for
cellar steps. Down there, where daylight never
came, a group of yellow, almond-eyed men were
bending over a table playing fan-tan. Their very
souls were in the game, every faculty of the mind
bent on the issue and the stake. The one blouse
that was indifferent to what went on was stretched
on a mat in a corner. One end of a clumsy pipe
was in his mouth, the other held over a little spirit-lamp
on the divan on which he lay. Something
fluttered in the flame with a pungent, unpleasant
smell. The smoker took a long draught, inhaling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the white smoke, then sank back on his couch in
senseless content.</p>

<p>Upstairs tiptoed the noiseless felt shoes, bent on
some house errand, to the "household" floors above,
where young white girls from the tenements of The
Bend and the East Side live in slavery worse, if not
more galling, than any of the galley with ball and
chain&mdash;the slavery of the pipe. Four, eight, sixteen,
twenty-odd such "homes" in this tenement,
disgracing the very name of home and family, for
marriage and troth are not in the bargain.</p>

<p>In one room, between the half-drawn curtains of
which the sunbeam works its way in, three girls are
lying on as many bunks, smoking all. They are
very young, "under age," though each and every
one would glibly swear in court to the satisfaction
of the police that she is sixteen, and therefore free
to make her own bad choice. Of these, one was
brought up among the rugged hills of Maine; the
other two are from the tenement crowds, hardly
missed there. But their companion? She is twirling
the sticky brown pill over the lamp, preparing
to fill the bowl of her pipe with it. As she does so,
the sunbeam dances across the bed, kisses the red
spot on her cheek that betrays the secret her tyrant
long has known,&mdash;though to her it is hidden yet,&mdash;that
the pipe has claimed its victim and soon will
pass it on to the Potter's Field.</p>

<p>"Nell," says one of her chums in the other bunk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
something stirred within her by the flash, "Nell,
did you hear from the old farm to home since you
come here?"</p>

<p>Nell turns half around, with the toasting-stick
in her hand, an ugly look on her wasted features, a
vile oath on her lips.</p>

<p>"To hell with the old farm," she says, and putting
the pipe to her mouth inhales it all, every bit,
in one long breath, then falls back on her pillow in
drunken stupor.</p>

<p>That is what the sun of a winter day saw and
heard in Mott Street.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It had travelled far toward the west, searching
many dark corners and vainly seeking entry to
others; had glided with equal impartiality the spires
of five hundred churches and the tin cornices of
thirty thousand tenements, with their million tenants
and more; had smiled courage and cheer to
patient mothers trying to make the most of life in
the teeming crowds, that had too little sunshine by
far; hope to toiling fathers striving early and late
for bread to fill the many mouths clamoring to be
fed.</p>

<p>The brief December day was far spent. Now its
rays fell across the North River and lighted up the
windows of the tenements in Hell's Kitchen and
Poverty Gap. In the Gap especially they made a
brave show; the windows of the crazy old frame-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
under the big tree that sat back from the
street looked as if they were made of beaten gold.
But the glory did not cross the threshold. Within
it was dark and dreary and cold. The room at the
foot of the rickety, patched stairs was empty. The
last tenant was beaten to death by her husband in
his drunken fury. The sun's rays shunned the spot
ever after, though it was long since it could have
made out the red daub from the mould on the rotten
floor.</p>

<p>Upstairs, in the cold attic, where the wind wailed
mournfully through every open crack, a little girl
sat sobbing as if her heart would break. She hugged
an old doll to her breast. The paint was gone from
its face; the yellow hair was in a tangle; its clothes
hung in rags. But she only hugged it closer. It
was her doll. They had been friends so long, shared
hunger and hardship together, and now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Her tears fell faster. One drop trembled upon
the wan cheek of the doll. The last sunbeam shot
athwart it and made it glisten like a priceless jewel.
Its glory grew and filled the room. Gone were the
black walls, the darkness, and the cold. There was
warmth and light and joy. Merry voices and glad
faces were all about. A flock of children danced
with gleeful shouts about a great Christmas tree in
the middle of the floor. Upon its branches hung
drums and trumpets and toys, and countless candles
gleamed like beautiful stars. Farthest up, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
very top, her doll, her very own, with arms outstretched,
as if appealing to be taken down and
hugged. She knew it, knew the mission-school that
had seen her first and only real Christmas, knew the
gentle face of her teacher, and the writing on the
wall she had taught her to spell out: "In His name."
His name, who, she had said, was all little children's
friend. Was He also her dolly's friend, and would
He know it among the strange people?</p>

<p>The light went out; the glory faded. The bare
room, only colder and more cheerless than before,
was left. The child shivered. Only that morning
the doctor had told her mother that she must have
medicine and food and warmth, or she must go to
the great hospital where papa had gone before, when
their money was all spent. Sorrow and want had
laid the mother upon the bed he had barely left.
Every stick of furniture, every stitch of clothing
on which money could be borrowed, had gone to the
pawnbroker. Last of all, she had carried mamma's
wedding-ring to pay the druggist. Now there was
no more left, and they had nothing to eat. In a
little while mamma would wake up, hungry.</p>

<p>The little girl smothered a last sob and rose
quickly. She wrapped the doll in a threadbare
shawl as well as she could, tiptoed to the door, and
listened a moment to the feeble breathing of the
sick mother within. Then she went out, shutting
the door softly behind her, lest she wake her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Up the street she went, the way she knew so well,
one block and a turn round the saloon corner, the
sunset glow kissing the track of her bare feet in the
snow as she went, to a door that rang a noisy bell
as she opened it and went in. A musty smell filled
the close room. Packages, great and small, lay piled
high on shelves behind the worn counter. A slovenly
woman was haggling with the pawnbroker about
the money for a skirt she had brought to pledge.</p>

<p>"Not a cent more than a quarter," he said, contemptuously,
tossing the garment aside. "It's half
worn out it is, dragging it back and forth over the
counter these six months. Take it or leave it.
Hallo! What have we here? Little Finnegan,
eh? Your mother not dead yet? It's in the poor-house
ye will be if she lasts much longer. What
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had taken the package from the trembling
child's hand&mdash;the precious doll&mdash;and unrolled the
shawl. A moment he stood staring in dumb amazement
at its contents. Then he caught it up and
flung it with an angry oath upon the floor, where it
was shivered against the coal-box.</p>

<p>"Get out o' here, ye Finnegan brat," he shouted;
"I'll tache ye to come a-guyin' o' me. I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door closed with a bang upon the frightened
child, alone in the cold night. The sun saw not
its home-coming. It had hidden behind the night
clouds, weary of the sight of man and his cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Evening had worn into night. The busy city
slept. Down by the wharves, now deserted, a poor
boy sat on the bulwark, hungry, foot-sore, and
shivering with cold. He sat thinking of friends
and home, thousands of miles away over the sea,
whom he had left six months before to go among
strangers. He had been alone ever since, but never
more so than that night. His money gone, no work
to be found, he had slept in the streets for nights.
That day he had eaten nothing; he would rather
die than beg, and one of the two he must do soon.</p>

<p>There was the dark river rushing at his feet; the
swirl of the unseen waters whispered to him of rest
and peace he had not known since&mdash;it was so cold&mdash;and
who was there to care, he thought bitterly. No
one would ever know. He moved a little nearer
the edge, and listened more intently.</p>

<p>A low whine fell on his ear, and a cold, wet face
was pressed against his. A little crippled dog that
had been crouching silently beside him nestled in
his lap. He had picked it up in the street, as forlorn
and friendless as himself, and it had stayed
by him. Its touch recalled him to himself. He got
up hastily, and, taking the dog in his arms, went
to the police station near by, and asked for shelter.
It was the first time he had accepted even such
charity, and as he lay down on his rough plank he
hugged a little gold locket he wore around his neck,
the last link with better days, and thought with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
hard sob of home. In the middle of the night he
awoke with a start. The locket was gone. One of
the tramps who slept with him had stolen it. With
bitter tears he went up and complained to the Sergeant
at the desk, and the Sergeant ordered him to
be kicked out into the street as a liar, if not a thief.
How should a tramp boy have come honestly by a
gold locket? The doorman put him out as he was
bidden, and when the little dog showed its teeth,
a policeman seized it and clubbed it to death on
the step.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Far from the slumbering city the rising moon
shines over a wide expanse of glistening water. It
silvers the snow upon a barren heath between two
shores, and shortens with each passing minute the
shadows of countless headstones that bear no names,
only numbers. The breakers that beat against the
bluff wake not those who sleep there. In the deep
trenches they lie, shoulder to shoulder, an army of
brothers, homeless in life, but here at rest and at
peace. A great cross stands upon the lonely shore.
The moon sheds its rays upon it in silent benediction
and floods the garden of the unknown, unmourned
dead with its soft light. Out on the Sound
the fishermen see it flashing white against the starlit
sky, and bare their heads reverently as their boats
speed by, borne upon the wings of the west wind.</p>

<h2 id="CHRISTMAS">NIBSY'S CHRISTMAS</h2></div>


<p>It was Christmas Eve over on the East Side.
Darkness was closing in on a cold, hard day. The
light that struggled through the frozen windows of
the delicatessen store and the saloon on the corner,
fell upon men with empty dinner-pails who were
hurrying homeward, their coats buttoned tightly,
and heads bent against the steady blast from the
river, as if they were butting their way down the
street.</p>

<p>The wind had forced the door of the saloon ajar,
and was whistling through the crack; but in there
it seemed to make no one afraid. Between roars of
laughter, the clink of glasses and the rattle of dice
on the hardwood counter were heard out in the
street. More than one of the passers-by who came
within range was taken with an extra shiver in
which the vision of wife and little ones waiting
at home for his coming was snuffed out, as he
dropped in to brace up. The lights were long out
when the silent streets reëchoed his unsteady steps
toward home, where the Christmas welcome had
turned to dread.</p>

<p>But in this twilight hour they burned brightly
yet, trying hard to pierce the bitter cold outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
with a ray of warmth and cheer. Where the lamps
in the delicatessen store made a mottled streak of
brightness across the flags, two little boys stood with
their noses flattened against the window. The
warmth inside, and the lights, had made little
islands of clear space on the frosty pane, affording
glimpses of the wealth within, of the piles of
smoked herring, of golden cheese, of sliced bacon
and generous, fat-bellied hams; of the rows of odd-shaped
bottles and jars on the shelves that held
there was no telling what good things, only it was
certain that they must be good from the looks of
them.</p>

<p>And the heavenly smell of spices and things that
reached the boys through the open door each time
the tinkling bell announced the coming or going of
a customer! Better than all, back there on the top
shelf the stacks of square honey-cakes, with their
frosty coats of sugar, tied in bundles with strips of
blue paper.</p>

<p>The wind blew straight through the patched and
threadbare jackets of the lads as they crept closer to
the window, struggling hard by breathing on the
pane to make their peep-holes bigger, to take in the
whole of the big cake with the almonds set in; but
they did not heed it.</p>

<p>"Jim!" piped the smaller of the two, after a
longer stare than usual; "hey, Jim! them's Sante
Claus's. See 'em?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
"Sante Claus!" snorted the other, scornfully,
applying his eye to the clear spot on the pane.
"There ain't no ole duffer like dat. Them's honey-cakes.
Me 'n' Tom had a bite o' one wunst."</p>

<p>"There ain't no Sante Claus?" retorted the
smaller shaver, hotly, at his peep-hole. "There is,
too. I seen him myself when he cum to our alley
last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's youse kids a-scrappin' fur?" broke in a
strange voice.</p>

<p>Another boy, bigger, but dirtier and tougher-looking
than either of the two, had come up behind
them unobserved. He carried an armful of unsold
"extras" under one arm. The other was buried to
the elbow in the pocket of his ragged trousers.</p>

<p>The "kids" knew him, evidently, and the smallest
eagerly accepted him as umpire.</p>

<p>"It's Jim w'at says there ain't no Sante Claus,
and I seen him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jim!" demanded the elder ragamuffin, sternly,
looking hard at the culprit; "Jim! yere a chump!
No Sante Claus? What're ye givin' us? Now,
watch me!"</p>

<p>With utter amazement the boys saw him disappear
through the door under the tinkling bell into
the charmed precincts of smoked herring, jam, and
honey-cakes. Petrified at their peep-holes, they
watched him, in the veritable presence of Santa
Claus himself with the fir-branch, fish out five bat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>tered
pennies from the depths of his pocket and pass
them over to the woman behind the jars, in exchange
for one of the bundles of honey-cakes tied
with blue. As if in a dream they saw him issue
forth with the coveted prize.</p>

<p>"There, kid!" he said, holding out the two
fattest and whitest cakes to Santa Claus's champion;
"there's yer Christmas. Run along, now, to
yer barracks; and you, Jim, here's one for you,
though yer don't desarve it. Mind ye let the kid
alone."</p>

<p>"This one'll have to do for me grub, I guess.
I ain't sold me 'Newses,' and the ole man'll kick
if I bring 'em home."</p>

<p>Before the shuffling feet of the ragamuffins
hurrying homeward had turned the corner, the last
mouthful of the newsboy's supper was smothered
in a yell of "Extree!" as he shot across the street
to intercept a passing stranger.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the evening wore on, it grew rawer and more
blustering still. Flakes of dry snow that stayed
where they fell, slowly tracing the curb-lines, the
shutters, and the doorsteps of the tenements with
gathering white, were borne up on the storm from
the water. To the right and left stretched endless
streets between the towering barracks, as beneath
frowning cliffs pierced with a thousand glowing
eyes that revealed the watch-fires within&mdash;a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
city of cave-dwellers held in the thraldom of poverty
and want.</p>

<p>Outside there was yet hurrying to and fro. Saloon
doors were slamming, and bare-legged urchins,
carrying beer-jugs, hugged the walls close for shelter.
From the depths of a blind alley floated out
the discordant strains of a vagabond brass band
"blowing in" the yule of the poor. Banished by
police ordinance from the street, it reaped a scant
harvest of pennies for Christmas cheer from the
windows opening on the back yard. Against more
than one pane showed the bald outline of a forlorn
little Christmas tree, some stray branch of a hemlock
picked up at the grocer's and set in a pail for "the
childer" to dance around, a dime's worth of candy
and tinsel on the boughs.</p>

<p>From the attic over the way came, in spells between,
the gentle tones of a German song about the
Christ-child. Christmas in the East Side tenements
begins with the sunset on the "Holy Eve," except
where the name is as a threat or a taunt. In a
hundred such homes the whir of many sewing-machines,
worked by the sweater's slaves with weary
feet and aching backs, drowned every feeble note
of joy that struggled to make itself heard above the
noise of the great treadmill.</p>

<p>To these what was Christmas but the name for
suffering, reminder of lost kindred and liberty, or
the slavery of eighteen hundred years, freedom from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which was purchased only with gold. Ay, gold!
The gold that had power to buy freedom yet, to
buy the good-will, ay, and the good name, of the
oppressor, with his houses and land. At the thought
the tired eye glistened, the aching back straightened,
and to the weary foot there came new strength to
finish the long task while the city slept.</p>

<p>Where a narrow passageway put in between two
big tenements to a ramshackle rear barrack, Nibsy,
the newsboy, halted in the shadow of the doorway
and stole a long look down the dark alley.</p>

<p>He toyed uncertainly with his still unsold papers&mdash;worn
dirty and ragged as his clothes by this
time&mdash;before he ventured in, picking his way between
barrels and heaps of garbage; past the Italian
cobbler's hovel, where a tallow dip, stuck in a
cracked beer-glass, before a picture of the "Mother
of God," showed that even he knew it was Christmas
and liked to show it; past the Sullivan flat,
where blows and drunken curses mingled with the
shriek of women, as Nibsy had heard many nights
before this one.</p>

<p>He shuddered as he felt his way past the door,
partly with a premonition of what was in store for
himself, if the "old man" was at home, partly
with a vague, uncomfortable feeling that somehow
Christmas Eve should be different from other nights,
even in the alley; down to its farthest end, to the
last rickety flight of steps that led into the filth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
darkness of the tenement. Up this he crept, three
flights, to a door at which he stopped and listened,
hesitating, as he had stopped at the entrance to
the alley; then, with a sudden, defiant gesture, he
pushed it open and went in.</p>

<p>A bare and cheerless room; a pile of rags for a
bed in the corner, another in the dark alcove, miscalled
bedroom; under the window a broken candle
and an iron-bound chest, upon which sat a sad-eyed
woman with hard lines in her face, peeling potatoes
in a pan; in the middle of the room a rusty stove,
with a pile of wood, chopped on the floor alongside.
A man on his knees in front fanning the fire with
an old slouch hat. With each breath of draught
he stirred; the crazy old pipe belched forth torrents
of smoke at every joint. As Nibsy entered, the man
desisted from his efforts and sat up, glaring at him&mdash;a
villainous ruffian's face, scowling with anger.</p>

<p>"Late ag'in!" he growled; "an' yer papers not
sold. What did I tell yer, brat, if ye dared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tom! Tom!" broke in the wife, in a desperate
attempt to soothe the ruffian's temper. "The boy
can't help it, an' it's Christmas Eve. For the love
o'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The devil take yer rot and yer brat!" shouted
the man, mad with the fury of passion. "Let me
at him!" and, reaching over, he seized a heavy knot
of wood and flung it at the head of the boy.</p>

<p>Nibsy had remained just inside the door, edging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
slowly toward his mother, but with a watchful eye
on the man at the stove. At the first movement
of his hand toward the woodpile he sprang for the
stairway with the agility of a cat, and just dodged
the missile. It struck the door, as he slammed it
behind him, with force enough to smash the panel.</p>

<p>Down the three flights in as many jumps he went,
and through the alley, over barrels and barriers,
never stopping once till he reached the street, and
curses and shouts were left behind.</p>

<p>In his flight he had lost his unsold papers, and
he felt ruefully in his pocket as he went down the
street, pulling his rags about him as much from
shame as to keep out the cold.</p>

<p>Four pennies were all he had left after his Christmas
treat to the two little lads from the barracks;
not enough for supper or for a bed; and it was
getting colder all the time.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk in front of the notion store a
belated Christmas party was in progress. The children
from the tenements in the alley and across
the way were having a game of blind-man's-buff,
groping blindly about in the crowd to catch each
other. They hailed Nibsy with shouts of laughter,
calling to him to join in.</p>

<p>"We're having Christmas!" they yelled.</p>

<p>Nibsy did not hear them. He was thinking,
thinking, the while turning over his four pennies at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the bottom of his pocket. Thinking if Christmas
was ever to come to him, and the children's Santa
Claus to find his alley where the baby slept within
reach of her father's cruel hand. As for him, he
had never known anything but blows and curses.
He could take care of himself. But his mother and
the baby&mdash;And then it came to him with shuddering
cold that it was getting late, and that he must
find a place to sleep.</p>

<p>He weighed in his mind the merits of two or three
places where he was in the habit of hiding from the
"cops" when the alley got to be too hot for him.</p>

<p>There was the hay barge down by the dock, with
the watchman who got drunk sometimes, and so
gave the boys a chance. The chances were at least
even of its being available on Christmas Eve, and
of Santa Claus having thus done him a good turn
after all.</p>

<p>Then there was the snug berth in the sand-box
you could curl all up in. Nibsy thought with regret
of its being, like the hay barge, so far away and to
windward, too.</p>

<p>Down by the printing-offices there were the steam
gratings, and a chance corner in the cellars, stories
and stories underground, where the big presses keep
up such a clatter from midnight till far into the
day.</p>

<p>As he passed them in review, Nibsy made up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
mind with sudden determination, and, setting his
face toward the south, made off down town.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The rumble of the last departing news-wagon
over the pavement, now buried deep in snow, had
died away in the distance, when, from out of the
bowels of the earth there issued a cry, a cry of
mortal terror and pain that was echoed by a hundred
throats.</p>

<p>From one of the deep cellar-ways a man ran out,
his clothes and hair and beard afire; on his heels a
breathless throng of men and boys; following them,
close behind, a rush of smoke and fire.</p>

<p>The clatter of the presses ceased suddenly, to be
followed quickly by the clangor of hurrying fire-bells.
With hooks and axes the firemen rushed in;
hose was let down through the manholes, and down
there in the depths the battle was fought and won.</p>

<p>The building was saved; but in the midst of the
rejoicing over the victory there fell a sudden silence.
From the cellar-way a grimy, helmeted figure arose,
with something black and scorched in his arms. A
tarpaulin was spread upon the snow and upon it
he laid his burden, while the silent crowd made
room and word went over to the hospital for the
doctor to come quickly.</p>

<p>Very gently they lifted poor little Nisby&mdash;for it
was he, caught in his berth by a worse enemy than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the "cop" or the watchman of the hay barge&mdash;into
the ambulance that bore him off to the hospital cot,
too late.</p>

<p>Conscious only of a vague discomfort that had
succeeded terror and pain, Nibsy wondered uneasily
why they were all so kind. Nobody had taken the
trouble to as much as notice him before. When he
had thrust his papers into their very faces they had
pushed him roughly aside.</p>

<p>Nibsy, unhurt and able to fight his way, never
had a show. Sick and maimed and sore, he was
being made much of, though he had been caught
where the boys were forbidden to go. Things were
queer, anyhow, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The room was getting so dark that he could
hardly see the doctor's kindly face, and had to grip
his hand tightly to make sure that he was there;
almost as dark as the stairs in the alley he had come
down in such a hurry.</p>

<p>There was the baby now&mdash;poor baby&mdash;and
mother&mdash;and then a great blank, and it was all a
mystery to poor Nibsy no longer. For, just as a
wild-eyed woman pushed her way through the
crowd of nurses and doctors to his bedside, crying
for her boy, Nibsy gave up his soul to God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was very quiet in the alley. Christmas had
come and gone. Upon the last door a bow of soiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
crape was nailed up with two tacks. It had done
duty there a dozen times before, that year.</p>

<p>Upstairs, Nibsy was at home, and for once the
neighbors, one and all, old and young, came to see
him.</p>

<p>Even the father, ruffian that he was, offered no
objection. Cowed and silent, he sat in the corner
by the window farthest from where the plain little
coffin stood, with the lid closed down.</p>

<p>A couple of the neighbor-women were talking in
low tones by the stove, when there came a timid
knock at the door. Nobody answering, it was
pushed open, first a little, then far enough to admit
the shrinking form of a little ragamuffin, the smaller
of the two who had stood breathing peep-holes on
the window pane of the delicatessen store the night
before when Nibsy came along.</p>

<p>He dragged with him a hemlock branch, the
leavings from some Christmas tree at the grocery.</p>

<p>"It's from Sante Claus," he said, laying it on the
coffin. "Nibsy knows." And he went out.</p>

<p>Santa Claus had come to Nibsy, after all, in his
alley. And Nibsy knew.</p>

<h2 id="JOURNEY">THE LITTLE DOLLAR'S CHRISTMAS
JOURNEY</h2></div>


<p>"It is too bad," said Mrs. Lee, and she put down
the magazine in which she had been reading of the
poor children in the tenements of the great city
that know little of Christmas joys; "no Christmas
tree! One of them shall have one, at any rate. I
think this will buy it, and it is so handy to send.
Nobody would know that there was money in the
letter." And she enclosed a coupon in a letter to
a professor, a friend in the city, who, she knew,
would have no trouble in finding the child, and had
it mailed at once. Mrs. Lee was a widow whose
not too great income was derived from the interest
on some four per cent government bonds which
represented the savings of her husband's life of toil,
that was none the less hard because it was spent
in a counting-room and not with shovel and spade.
The coupon looked for all the world like a dollar
bill, except that it was so small that a baby's hand
could easily cover it. The United States, the printing
on it said, would pay on demand to the bearer
one dollar; and there was a number on it, just as
on a full-grown dollar, that was the number of the
bond from which it had been cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter travelled all night, and was tossed and
sorted and bunched at the end of its journey in the
great gray beehive that never sleeps, day or night,
and where half the tears and joys of the land, including
this account of the little dollar, are checked
off unceasingly as first-class matter or second or
third, as the case may be. In the morning it was
laid, none the worse for its journey, at the professor's
breakfast plate. The professor was a kindly
man, and he smiled as he read it. "To procure one
small Christmas tree for a poor tenement," was its
errand.</p>

<p>"Little dollar," he said, "I think I know where
you are needed." And he made a note in his book.
There were other notes there that made him smile
again as he saw them. They had names set opposite
them. One about a Noah's ark was marked "Vivi."
That was the baby; and there was one about a doll's
carriage that had the words "Katie, sure," set over
against it. The professor eyed the list in mock
dismay.</p>

<p>"How ever will I do it?" he sighed, as he put
on his hat.</p>

<p>"Well, you will have to get Santa Claus to help
you, John," said his wife, buttoning his greatcoat
about him. "And, mercy! the duckses' babies! don't
forget them, whatever you do. The baby has been
talking about nothing else since he saw them at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
store, the old duck and the two ducklings on wheels.
You know them, John?"</p>

<p>But the professor was gone, repeating to himself
as he went down the garden walk, "The duckses'
babies, indeed!" He chuckled as he said it, why
I cannot tell. He was very particular about his
grammar, was the professor, ordinarily. Perhaps
it was because it was Christmas eve.</p>

<p>Down town went the professor; but instead of
going with the crowd that was setting toward Santa
Claus's headquarters, in the big Broadway store,
he turned off into a quieter street, leading west. It
took him to a narrow thoroughfare, with five-story
tenements frowning on their side, where the people
he met were not so well dressed as those he had left
behind, and did not seem to be in such a hurry of
joyful anticipation of the holiday. Into one of the
tenements he went, and, groping his way through
a pitch-dark hall, came to a door way back, the
last one to the left, at which he knocked. An expectant
voice said, "Come in," and the professor
pushed open the door.</p>

<p>The room was very small, very stuffy, and very
dark, so dark that a smoking kerosene lamp that
burned on a table next the stove hardly lighted it
at all, though it was broad day. A big, unshaven
man, who sat on the bed, rose when he saw the
visitor, and stood uncomfortably shifting his feet
and avoiding the professor's eye. The latter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
glance was serious, though not unkind, as he asked
the woman with the baby if he had found no work
yet.</p>

<p>"No," she said, anxiously coming to the rescue,
"not yet; he was waitin' for a recommend." But
Johnnie had earned two dollars running errands,
and, now there was a big fall of snow, his father
might get a job of shovelling. The woman's face
was worried, yet there was a cheerful note in her
voice that somehow made the place seem less discouraging
than it was. The baby she nursed was
not much larger than a middle-sized doll. Its little
face looked thin and wan. It had been very sick,
she explained, but the doctor said it was mending
now. That was good, said the professor, and patted
one of the bigger children on the head.</p>

<p>There were six of them, of all sizes, from
Johnnie, who could run errands, down. They were
busy fixing up a Christmas tree that half filled the
room, though it was of the very smallest. Yet, it
was a real Christmas tree, left over from the Sunday-school
stock, and it was dressed up at that.
Pictures from the colored supplement of a Sunday
newspaper hung and stood on every branch, and
three pieces of colored glass, suspended on threads
that shone in the smoky lamplight, lent color and
real beauty to the show. The children were greatly
tickled.</p>

<p>"John put it up," said the mother, by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
explanation, as the professor eyed it approvingly.
"There ain't nothing to eat on it. If there was,
it wouldn't be there a minute. The childer be always
a-searchin' in it."</p>

<p>"But there must be, or else it isn't a real Christmas
tree," said the professor, and brought out the
little dollar. "This is a dollar which a friend gave
me for the children's Christmas, and she sends her
love with it. Now, you buy them some things and
a few candles, Mrs. Ferguson, and then a good
supper for the rest of the family. Good night, and
a Merry Christmas to you. I think myself the baby
is getting better." It had just opened its eyes and
laughed at the tree.</p>

<p>The professor was not very far on his way toward
keeping his appointment with Santa Claus before
Mrs. Ferguson was at the grocery laying in her
dinner. A dollar goes a long way when it is the
only one in the house; and when she had everything,
including two cents' worth of flitter-gold, four apples,
and five candles for the tree, the grocer footed
up her bill on the bag that held her potatoes&mdash;ninety-eight
cents. Mrs. Ferguson gave him the
little dollar.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said the grocer, his fat smile
turning cold as he laid a restraining hand on the
full basket. "That ain't no good."</p>

<p>"It's a dollar, ain't it?" said the woman, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
alarm. "It's all right. I know the man that give
it to me."</p>

<p>"It ain't all right in this store," said the grocer,
sternly. "Put them things back. I want none o'
that."</p>

<p>The woman's eyes filled with tears as she slowly
took the lid off the basket and lifted out the precious
bag of potatoes. They were waiting for that
dinner at home. The children were even then
camping on the doorstep to take her in to the tree
in triumph. And now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>For the second time a restraining hand was laid
upon her basket; but this time it was not the
grocer's. A gentleman who had come in to order a
Christmas turkey had overheard the conversation,
and had seen the strange bill.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he said to the grocer. "Give it
to me. Here is a dollar bill for it of the kind you
know. If all your groceries were as honest as this
bill, Mr. Schmidt, it would be a pleasure to trade
with you. Don't be afraid to trust Uncle Sam
where you see his promise to pay."</p>

<p>The gentleman held the door open for Mrs.
Ferguson, and heard the shout of the delegation
awaiting her on the stoop as he went down the
street.</p>

<p>"I wonder where that came from, now," he
mused. "Coupons in Bedford Street! I suppose
somebody sent it to the woman for a Christmas gift.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Hello! Here are old Thomas and Snowflake. Now,
wouldn't it surprise her old stomach if I gave her
a Christmas gift of oats? If only the shock doesn't
kill her! Thomas! Oh, Thomas!"</p>

<p>The old man thus hailed stopped and awaited the
gentleman's coming. He was a cartman who did
odd jobs through the ward, so picking up a living
for himself and the white horse, which the boys had
dubbed Snowflake in a spirit of fun. They were a
well-matched old pair, Thomas and his horse. One
was not more decrepit than the other.</p>

<p>There was a tradition along the docks, where
Thomas found a job now and then, and Snowflake
an occasional straw to lunch on, that they were of
an age, but this was denied by Thomas.</p>

<p>"See here," said the gentleman, as he caught up
with them; "I want Snowflake to keep Christmas,
Thomas. Take this and buy him a bag of oats.
And give it to him carefully, do you hear?&mdash;not all
at once, Thomas. He isn't used to it."</p>

<p>"Gee whizz!" said the old man, rubbing his eyes
with his cap, as his friend passed out of sight, "oats
fer Christmas! G'lang, Snowflake; yer in luck."</p>

<p>The feed-man put on his spectacles and looked
Thomas over at the strange order. Then he scanned
the little dollar, first on one side, then on the other.</p>

<p>"Never seed one like him," he said. "'Pears to
me he is mighty short. Wait till I send round to
the hockshop. He'll know, if anybody."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The man at the pawnshop did not need a second
look. "Why, of course," he said, and handed a
dollar bill over the counter. "Old Thomas, did you
say? Well, I am blamed if the old man ain't got
a stocking after all. They're a sly pair, he and
Snowflake."</p>

<p>Business was brisk that day at the pawnshop.
The door-bell tinkled early and late, and the stock
on the shelves grew. Bundle was added to bundle.
It had been a hard winter so far. Among the callers
in the early afternoon was a young girl in a gingham
dress and without other covering, who stood timidly
at the counter and asked for three dollars on a
watch, a keepsake evidently, which she was loath to
part with. Perhaps it was the last glimpse of
brighter days. The pawnbroker was doubtful; it
was not worth so much. She pleaded hard, while
he compared the number of the movement with a
list sent in from Police Headquarters.</p>

<p>"Two," he said decisively at last, snapping the
case shut&mdash;"two or nothing." The girl handed over
the watch with a troubled sigh. He made out a
ticket and gave it to her with a handful of silver
change.</p>

<p>Was it the sigh and her evident distress, or was
it the little dollar? As she turned to go, he called
her back.</p>

<p>"Here, it is Christmas!" he said. "I'll run the
risk." And he added the coupon to the little heap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl looked at it and at him questioningly.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he said; "you can take it; I'm
running short of change. Bring it back if they
won't take it. I'm good for it." Uncle Sam had
achieved a backer.</p>

<p>In Grand Street the holiday crowds jammed
every store in their eager hunt for bargains. In
one of them, at the knit-goods counter, stood the
girl from the pawnshop, picking out a thick, warm
shawl. She hesitated between a gray and a maroon-colored
one, and held them up to the light.</p>

<p>"For you?" asked the salesgirl, thinking to aid
her. She glanced at her thin dress and shivering
form as she said it.</p>

<p>"No," said the girl; "for mother; she is poorly
and needs it." She chose the gray, and gave the
salesgirl her handful of money.</p>

<p>The girl gave back the coupon.</p>

<p>"They don't go," she said; "give me another,
please."</p>

<p>"But I haven't got another," said the girl,
looking apprehensively at the shawl. "The&mdash;Mr.
Feeney said it was all right. Take it to the desk,
please, and ask."</p>

<p>The salesgirl took the bill and the shawl, and
went to the desk. She came back, almost immediately,
with the storekeeper, who looked sharply at
the customer and noted the number of the coupon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is all right," he said, satisfied apparently by
the inspection; "a little unusual, only. We don't
see many of them. Can I help you, miss?" And he
attended her to the door.</p>

<p>In the street there was even more of a Christmas
show going on than in the stores. Pedlers of toys,
of mottoes, of candles, and of knickknacks of every
description stood in rows along the curb, and were
driving a lively trade. Their push-carts were
decorated with fir branches&mdash;even whole Christmas
trees. One held a whole cargo of Santa Clauses in
a bower of green, each one with a cedar-bush in his
folded arms, as a soldier carries his gun. The lights
were blazing out in the stores, and the hucksters'
torches were flaring at the corners. There was
Christmas in the very air and Christmas in the
storekeeper's till. It had been a very busy day.
He thought of it with a satisfied nod as he stood
a moment breathing the brisk air of the winter day,
absently fingering the coupon the girl had paid for
the shawl. A thin voice at his elbow said: "Merry
Christmas, Mr. Stein! Here's yer paper."</p>

<p>It was the newsboy who left the evening papers
at the door every night. The storekeeper knew him,
and something about the struggle they had at home
to keep the roof over their heads. Mike was a kind
of protégé of his. He had helped to get him his
route.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait a bit, Mike," he said. "You'll be wanting
your Christmas from me. Here's a dollar. It's just
like yourself: it is small, but it is all right. You
take it home and have a good time."</p>

<p>Was it the message with which it had been sent
forth from far away in the country, or what was it?
Whatever it was, it was just impossible for the little
dollar to lie still in the pocket while there was want
to be relieved, mouths to be filled, or Christmas
lights to be lit. It just couldn't, and it didn't.</p>

<p>Mike stopped around the corner of Allen Street,
and gave three whoops expressive of his approval
of Mr. Stein; having done which, he sidled up to
the first lighted window out of range to examine his
gift. His enthusiasm changed to open-mouthed
astonishment as he saw the little dollar. His jaw
fell. Mike was not much of a scholar, and could
not make out the inscription on the coupon; but he
had heard of shinplasters as something they "had in
the war," and he took this to be some sort of a ten-cent
piece. The policeman on the block might tell.
Just now he and Mike were hunk. They had made
up a little difference they'd had, and if any one
would know, the cop surely would. And off he went
in search of him.</p>

<p>Mr. McCarthy pulled off his gloves, put his club
under his arm, and studied the little dollar with
contracted brow. He shook his head as he handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
it back, and rendered the opinion that it was "some
dom swindle that's ag'in the law." He advised
Mike to take it back to Mr. Stein, and added, as he
prodded him in an entirely friendly manner in the
ribs with his locust, that if it had been the week
before he might have "run him in" for having the
thing in his possession. As it happened, Mr. Stein
was busy and not to be seen, and Mike went home
between hope and fear, with his doubtful prize.</p>

<p>There was a crowd at the door of the tenement,
and Mike saw, before he had reached it, running,
that it clustered about an ambulance that was
backed up to the sidewalk. Just as he pushed his
way through the throng it drove off, its clanging
gong scattering the people right and left. A little
girl sat weeping on the top step of the stoop. To
her Mike turned for information.</p>

<p>"Susie, what's up?" he asked, confronting her
with his armful of papers. "Who's got hurted?"</p>

<p>"It's papa," sobbed the girl. "He ain't hurted.
He's sick, and he was took that bad he had to go,
an' to-morrer is Christmas, an'&mdash;oh, Mike!"</p>

<p>It is not the fashion of Essex Street to slop over.
Mike didn't. He just set his mouth to a whistle
and took a turn down the hall to think. Susie was
his chum. There were seven in her flat; in his only
four, including two that made wages. He came
back from his trip with his mind made up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suse," he said, "come on in. You take this, Suse,
see! an' let the kids have their Christmas. Mr.
Stein give it to me. It's a little one, but if it ain't
all right I'll take it back and get one that is good.
Go on, now, Suse, you hear?" And he was gone.</p>

<p>There was a Christmas tree that night in Susie's
flat, with candles and apples and shining gold, but
the little dollar did not pay for it. That rested
securely in the purse of the charity visitor who had
come that afternoon, just at the right time, as it
proved. She had heard the story of Mike and his
sacrifice, and had herself given the children a one-dollar
bill for the coupon. They had their Christmas,
and a joyful one, too, for the lady went up to
the hospital and brought back word that Susie's
father would be all right with rest and care, which
he was now getting. Mike came in and helped
them "sack" the tree when the lady was gone. He
gave three more whoops for Mr. Stein, three for the
lady, and three for the hospital doctor to even
things up. Essex Street was all right that night.</p>

<p>"Do you know, professor," said that learned
man's wife, when, after supper, he had settled down
in his easy-chair to admire the Noah's ark and the
duckses' babies and the rest, all of which had arrived
safely by express ahead of him and were waiting
to be detailed to their appropriate stockings
while the children slept&mdash;"do you know, I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
such a story of a little newsboy to-day. It was at
the meeting of our district charity committee this
evening. Miss Linder, our visitor, came right from
the house." And she told the story of Mike and
Susie.</p>

<p>"And I just got the little dollar bill to keep.
Here it is." She took the coupon out of her purse
and passed it to her husband.</p>

<p>"Eh! what?" said the professor, adjusting his
spectacles and reading the number. "If here isn't
my little dollar come back to me! Why, where
have you been, little one? I left you in Bedford
Street this morning, and here you come by way of
Essex. Well, I declare!" And he told his wife
how he had received it in a letter in the morning.</p>

<p>"John," she said, with a sudden impulse,&mdash;she
didn't know, and neither did he, that it was the
charm of the little dollar that was working again,&mdash;"John,
I guess it is a sin to stop it. Jones's children
won't have any Christmas tree, because they
can't afford it. He told me so this morning when
he fixed the furnace. And the baby is sick. Let us
give them the little dollar. He is here in the kitchen
now."</p>

<p>And they did; and the Joneses, and I don't know
how many others, had a Merry Christmas because
of the blessed little dollar that carried Christmas
cheer and good luck wherever it went. For all I
know, it may be going yet. Certainly it is a sin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
stop it, and if any one has locked it up without
knowing that he locked up the Christmas dollar, let
him start it right out again. He can tell it easily
enough. If he just looks at the number, that's the
one.</p>

<h2 id="MESSAGE">LITTLE WILL'S MESSAGE</h2></div>


<p>"It is that or starve, Captain. I can't get a job.
God knows I've tried, but without a recommend,
it's no use. I ain't no good at beggin'. And&mdash;and&mdash;there's
the childer."</p>

<p>There was a desperate note in the man's voice
that made the Captain turn and look sharply at him.
A swarthy, strongly built man in a rough coat, and
with that in his dark face which told that he had
lived longer than his years, stood at the door of the
Detective Office. His hand that gripped the door
handle shook so that the knob rattled in his grasp,
but not with fear. He was no stranger to that
place. Black Bill's face had looked out from the
Rogues' Gallery longer than most of those now there
could remember. The Captain looked him over in
silence.</p>

<p>"You had better not, Bill," he said. "You know
what will come of it. When you go up again it
will be the last time. And up you go, sure."</p>

<p>The man started to say something, but choked it
down and went out without a word. The Captain
got up and rang his bell.</p>

<p>"Bill, who was here just now, is off again," he
said to the officer who came to the door. "He says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
it is steal or starve, and he can't get a job. I guess
he is right. Who wants a thief in his pay? And
how can I recommend him? And still I think he
would keep straight if he had the chance. Tell
Murphy to look after him and see what he is up to."</p>

<p>The Captain went out, tugging viciously at his
gloves. He was in very bad humor. The policeman
at the Mulberry Street door got hardly a nod
for his cheery "Merry Christmas" as he passed.</p>

<p>"Wonder what's crossed him," he said, looking
down the street after him.</p>

<p>The green lamps were lighted and shone upon
the hurrying six o'clock crowds from the Broadway
shops. In the great business buildings the iron
shutters were pulled down and the lights put out,
and in a little while the reporters' boys that carried
slips from Headquarters to the newspaper offices
across the street were the only tenants of the block.
A stray policeman stopped now and then on the
corner and tapped the lamp-post reflectively with
his club as he looked down the deserted street and
wondered, as his glance rested upon the Chief's
darkened windows, how it felt to have six thousand
dollars a year and every night off. In the Detective
Office the Sergeant who had come in at roll-call
stretched himself behind the desk and thought of
home. The lights of a Christmas tree in the abutting
Mott Street tenement shone through his window,
and the laughter of children mingled with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
tap of the toy drum. He pulled down the sash in
order to hear better. As he did so, a strong draught
swept his desk. The outer door slammed. Two
detectives came in bringing a prisoner between
them. A woman accompanied them.</p>

<p>The Sergeant pulled the blotter toward him mechanically
and dipped his pen.</p>

<p>"What's the charge?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Picking pockets in Fourteenth Street. This lady
is the complainant, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The name was that of a well-known police magistrate.
The Sergeant looked up and bowed. His
glance took in the prisoner, and a look of recognition
came into his face.</p>

<p>"What, Bill! So soon?" he said.</p>

<p>The prisoner was sullenly silent. He answered
the questions put to him briefly, and was searched.
The stolen pocket-book, a small paper package, and
a crumpled letter were laid upon the desk. The
Sergeant saw only the pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Looks bad," he said with wrinkled brow.</p>

<p>"We caught him at it," explained the officer.
"Guess Bill has lost heart. He didn't seem to care.
Didn't even try to get away."</p>

<p>The prisoner was taken to a cell. Silence fell
once more upon the office. The Sergeant made a
few red lines in the blotter and resumed his reveries.
He was not in a mood for work. He hitched his
chair nearer the window and looked across the yard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
But the lights there were put out, the children's
laughter had died away. Out of sorts at he hardly
knew what, he leaned back in his chair, with his
hands under the back of his head. Here it was
Christmas Eve, and he at the desk instead of being
out with the old woman buying things for the children.
He thought with a sudden pang of conscience
of the sled he had promised to get for Johnnie and
had forgotten. That was hard luck. And what
would Katie say when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He had got that far when his eye, roaming idly
over the desk, rested upon the little package taken
from the thief's pocket. Something about it seemed
to move him with sudden interest. He sat up and
reached for it. He felt it carefully all over. Then
he undid the package slowly and drew forth a
woolly sheep. It had a blue ribbon about its neck,
with a tiny bell hung on it.</p>

<p>The Sergeant set the sheep upon the desk and
looked at it fixedly for better than a minute. Having
apparently studied out its mechanism, he pulled
its head and it baa-ed. He pulled it once more, and
nodded. Then he took up the crumpled letter and
opened it.</p>

<p>This was what he read, scrawled in a child's
uncertain hand:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Deer Sante Claas&mdash;Pease wont yer bring me a
sjeep wat bas. Aggie had won wonst. An Kate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
wants a dollie offul. In the reere 718 19th Street
by the gas house. Your friend Will."</p>

<p>The Sergeant read it over twice very carefully
and glanced over the page at the sheep, as if taking
stock and wondering why Kate's dollie was not
there. Then he took the sheep and the letter and
went over to the Captain's door. A gruff "Come
in!" answered his knock. The Captain was pulling
off his overcoat. He had just come in from his
dinner.</p>

<p>"Captain," said the Sergeant, "we found this in
the pocket of Black Bill who is locked up for picking
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s pocket an hour ago. It is a clear
case. He didn't even try to give them the slip,"
and he set the sheep upon the table and laid the
letter beside it.</p>

<p>"Black Bill?" said the Captain, with something
of a start; "the dickens you say!" And he took up
the letter and read it. He was not a very good
penman, was little Will. The Captain had even a
harder time of it than the Sergeant had had making
out his message. Three times he went over it, spelling
out the words, and each time comparing it with
the woolly exhibit that was part of the evidence,
before he seemed to understand. Then it was in a
voice that would have frightened little Will very
much could he have heard it, and with a black look
under his bushy eyebrows, that he bade the Sergeant
"Fetch Bill up here!" One might almost have ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>pected
the little white lamb to have taken to its
heels with fright at having raised such a storm,
could it have run at all. But it showed no signs
of fear. On the contrary it baa-ed quite lustily
when the Sergeant should have been safely out of
earshot. The hand of the Captain had accidentally
rested upon the woolly head in putting down the
letter. But the Sergeant was not out of earshot.
He heard it and grinned.</p>

<p>An iron door in the basement clanged and
there were steps in the passageway. The doorman
brought in Bill. He stood by the door, sullenly
submissive. The Captain raised his head. It was
in the shade.</p>

<p>"So you are back, are you?" he said.</p>

<p>The thief nodded.</p>

<p>The Captain bent his brows upon him and said
with sudden fierceness, "You couldn't keep honest
a month, could you?"</p>

<p>"They wouldn't let me. Who wants a thief in
his pay? And the children were starving."</p>

<p>It was said patiently enough, but it made the
Captain wince all the same. They were his own
words. But he did not give in so easily.</p>

<p>"Starving?" he repeated harshly. "And that's
why you got this, I suppose," and he pushed the
sheep from under the newspaper that had fallen
upon it by accident and covered it up.</p>

<p>The thief looked at it and flushed to the temples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
He tried to speak but could not. His face worked,
and he seemed to be strangling. In the middle of
his fight to master himself he saw the child's crumpled
message on the desk. Taking a quick step
across the room he snatched it up, wildly, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Captain," he gasped, and broke down utterly.
The hardened thief wept like a woman.</p>

<p>The Captain rang his bell. He stood with his
back to the prisoner when the doorman came in.
"Take him down," he commanded. And the iron
door clanged once more behind the prisoner.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the reporters were discussing
across the way the nature of "the case" which the
night promised to develop. They had piped off
the Captain and one of his trusted men leaving the
building together, bound east. Could they have
followed them all the way, they would have seen
them get off the car at Nineteenth Street, and go
toward the gas house, carefully scanning the numbers
of the houses as they went. They found one
at last before which they halted. The Captain
searched in his pocket and drew forth the baby's
letter to Santa Claus, and they examined the number
under the gas lamp. Yes, that was right. The
door was open, and they went right through to the
rear.</p>

<p>Up in the third story three little noses were flattened
against the window pane, and three childish
mouths were breathing peep-holes through which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
keep a lookout for the expected Santa Claus. It
was cold, for there was no fire in the room, but in
their fever of excitement the children didn't mind
that. They were bestowing all their attention upon
keeping the peep-holes open.</p>

<p>"Do you think he will come?" asked the oldest
boy&mdash;there were two boys and a girl&mdash;of Kate.</p>

<p>"Yes, he will. I know he will come. Papa said
so," said the child in a tone of conviction.</p>

<p>"I'se so hungry, and I want my sheep," said Baby
Will.</p>

<p>"Wait and I'll tell you of the wolf," said his
sister, and she took him on her lap. She had barely
started when there were steps on the stairs and a tap
on the door. Before the half-frightened children
could answer it was pushed open. Two men stood
on the threshold. One wore a big fur overcoat.
The baby looked at him in wide-eyed wonder.</p>

<p>"Is you Santa Claus?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, my little man, and are you Baby Will?"
said a voice that was singularly different from the
harsh one Baby Will's father had heard so recently
in the Captain's office, and yet very like it.</p>

<p>"See. This is for you, I guess," and out of the
big roomy pocket came the woolly sheep and baa-ed
right off as if it were his own pasture in which he
was at home. And well might any sheep be content
nestling at a baby heart so brimful of happiness as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
little Will's was then, child of a thief though he
was.</p>

<p>"Papa spoke for it, and he spoke for Kate, too,
and I guess for everybody," said the bogus Santa
Claus, "and it is all right. My sled will be here
in a minute. Now we will just get to work and
make ready for him. All help!"</p>

<p>The Sergeant behind the desk in the Detective
Office might have had a fit had he been able to
witness the goings-on in that rear tenement in the
next hour; and then again he might not. There is
no telling about those Sergeants. The way that
poor flat laid itself out of a sudden was fairly staggering.
It was not only that a fire was made and
that the pantry filled up in the most extraordinary
manner; but a real Christmas tree sprang up, out
of the floor, as it were, and was found to be all
besprinkled with gold and stars and cornucopias
with sugarplums. From the top of it, which was
not higher than Santa Claus could easily reach,
because the ceiling was low, a marvellous doll, with
real hair and with eyes that could open and shut,
looked down with arms wide open to take Kate to
its soft wax heart. Under the branches of the tree
browsed every animal that went into and came out
of Noah's Ark, and there were glorious games of
Messenger Boy and Three Bad Bears, and honey-cakes
and candy apples, and a little yellow-bird in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
a cage, and what not? It was glorious. And when
the tea-kettle began to sing, skilfully manipulated
by Santa Claus's assistant, who nominally was
known in Mulberry Street as Detective Sergeant
Murphy, it was just too lovely for anything. The
baby's eyes grew wider and wider, and Kate's were
shining with happiness, when in the midst of it all
she suddenly stopped and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But where is papa? Why don't he come?"</p>

<p>Santa Claus gave a little start at the sudden
question, but pulled himself together right away.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he said, "he must have got lost.
Now you are all right we will just go and see if
we can find him. Mrs. McCarthy here next door
will help you keep the kettle boiling and the lights
burning till we come back. Just let me hear that
sheep baa once more. That's right! I bet we'll
find papa." And out they went.</p>

<p>An hour later, while Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the Magistrate,
and his good wife were viewing with mock dismay
the array of little stockings at their hearth in their
fine up-town house, and talking of the adventure of
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; with the pickpocket, there came a ring
at the door-bell and the Captain of the detectives
was ushered in. What he told them I do not know,
but this I do know, that when he went away the
honorable Magistrate went with him, and his wife
waved good-by to them from the stoop with wet
eyes as they drove away in a carriage hastily ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
up from a livery stable. While they drove down
town, the Magistrate's wife went up to the nursery
and hugged her sleeping little ones, one after the
other, and tear-drops fell upon their warm cheeks
that had wiped out the guilt of more than one sinner
before, and the children smiled in their sleep. They
say among the simple-minded folk of far-away Denmark
that then they see angels in their dreams.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped in Mulberry Street, in front
of Police Headquarters, and there was great scurrying
among the reporters, for now they were sure of
their "case." But no "prominent citizen" came out,
made free by the Magistrate, who opened court in
the Captain's office. Only a rough-looking man
with a flushed face, whom no one knew, and who
stopped on the corner and looked back as one in a
dream and then went east, the way the Captain and
his man had gone on their expedition personating
no less exalted a personage than Santa Claus
himself.</p>

<p>That night there was Christmas, indeed, in the
rear tenement "near the gas house," for papa had
come home just in time to share in its cheer. And
there was no one who did it with a better will, for
the Christmas evening that began so badly was the
luckiest night in his life. He had the promise of a
job on the morrow in his pocket, along with something
to keep the wolf from the door in the holidays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
His hard days were over, and he was at last to have
his chance to live an honest life. And it was the
baby's letter to Santa Claus and the baa sheep that
did it all, with the able assistance of the Captain
and the Sergeant. Don't let us forget the Sergeant.</p>

<h2 id="CHRISTMAS2">THE BURGOMASTER'S CHRISTMAS</h2></div>


<p>The burgomaster was in a bad humor. The
smoke from his long pipe, which ordinarily rose in
leisurely meditative rings signaling official calm and
fair weather, came to-day in short, angry puffs as
he tossed his mail impatiently about on the desk.
A reprimand from headquarters, where they knew
about as much of a burgomaster's actual work as
he of the prime minister's! Less. Those bureaucrats
never came in touch with real things. He
smiled a little grimly as he thought that that was
what his own people had said of him when twenty
years before he had come from the capital to the
little provincial town with his mind firmly made
up to many things which&mdash;well, a man grows older
and wiser. Life has its lessons for men, though it
pass by the red tape in department bureaus. That
never changes. His people and he, now&mdash;The
stern wrinkle in the furrowed forehead relaxed, and
he leaned back in his chair, blowing a long, contented
ring, which brought a sigh of relief from the
old clerk in the outer office. The skies were clearing.</p>

<p>In truth, despite his habitual sternness of manner,
there was no more beloved man in the town of Hammel
than the burgomaster. His kindness of heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
was proverbial. The law had in him a faithful
executor; the staff of office was no willow wand
in his hand to bend to every wind that blew. To
the evil-doer he was a hard master, but many were
the stories that were whispered of how, having sent
a thief to jail, he had taken care of his wife and
children, who were not to blame. In fact, word
had come from more than one distant town of how
this or that ne'er-do-well, after squaring himself
with the law in Burgomaster Brent's jurisdiction,
had made a new start, helped somehow where he
might have expected frowns and suspicion. But of
this, Hammel tongues were careful not to wag
within that official's hearing. Those things were
his secret, if, indeed,&mdash;the matrons wagged their
heads knowingly,&mdash;they were not his wife's, the
burgomasterinde's; and so they were to stay.</p>

<p>Whether something of all this had come to
smooth the burgomaster's brow or not, it was not
for long. There was a tap on the door, and, in
answer to his brisk "Come in," there entered Jens,
the forester, with a swarthy, sullen-looking prisoner.
Jens saluted and stood, cap in hand.</p>

<p>"Black Hans," he said briefly. "We took him
last night in the meadow brake with a young roe."</p>

<p>The burgomaster's face grew cold and stern.
Black Hans was an old offender. As a magistrate
the burgomaster had given him a chance twice, but
he was a confirmed poacher, who would rather lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
out in the woods through a cold winter's night on
the chance of getting a deer, and of getting into jail,
too, than work a day at good wages, clever blacksmith
though he was. Now he had been caught
red-handed, and would be made to suffer for it.
The burgomaster bent lowering brows upon the
prisoner.</p>

<p>"You couldn't keep from stealing the count's
deer, not even at Christmas," he said harshly.</p>

<p>The poacher looked up. Rough as he was, he was
not a bad-looking fellow. The free, if lawless, life
he led was in his face and bearing.</p>

<p>"The deer is wild. They're for the man as can
take 'em, if the count do claim 'em," he said doggedly,
and halted, as with a sudden thought. Something
had entered with him and the forester, and
was even then filling the room with a suggestion
of good cheer to come. It was the smell of the Yule
goose roasting in the burgomaster's kitchen. Black
Hans looked straight into the eye of his inquisitor.</p>

<p>"I didn't have none&mdash;for me young ones," he
added. It was not said defiantly, but as a mere
statement of fact.</p>

<p>An angry reply rose to the official's lip, but he
checked himself.</p>

<p>"Take him to the lock-up," he ordered shortly,
and the forester went out with his charge.</p>

<p>The burgomaster heard the outer door close behind
them, and turned wearily to his mail. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
count had been greatly wrought up over the depredations
of Black Hans and his kind, and would
insist on an example being made of him. Bad blood
always came of these cases, for the game law was
not well thought of in the land in these democratic
days. There lingered yet resentfully the recollection
of the days not so long since when to take "the
king's deer" brought a man to the block, or to the
treadmill for life. And the family of this fellow
Black Hans, what was to become of them? The
burgomaster's gaze wandered abstractedly over the
envelop he was opening and rested on an unfamiliar
stamp. He held it up and took a closer look. Oh,
yes; the new Christmas stamp. He knew it well
enough, with its design of the great sanatorium for
tubercular children that had been built out of the
proceeds of other years' sales. It was a pretty picture,
and a worthy cause. In all Denmark there
was none that so laid hold of the popular fancy.
It was the word "Yule," with its magic, that did it.
There was no other inscription on the stamp, and
none was needed.</p>

<p>As his glance dwelt upon it, a curious change
came over the picture. It was no longer the great
white house that he saw, with its many bright lights,
but a wretched hut, with a crooked chimney, and
rags stopping a broken pane in its only window.
The dull glow of a tallow dip struggled through
the grime that lay thick upon the unbroken panes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Against one the face of a child was pressed, a poor,
pinched face that spoke of cold and hunger and
weary waiting for some one who was always late.
Something that was very much like real pain made
the burgomaster wince as the words of Black Hans
came back to him, "I didn't have none&mdash;for me
young ones."</p>

<p>He shook his head impatiently. Why, then, did
he not work for them, instead of laying it up against
his betters?</p>

<p>The sober little face at the window kept looking
out into the night, straight past the burgomaster,
as if he were not there. How many of them in that
hut? Seven, eight, nine, the burgomaster counted
mentally; or was it ten ragged, underfed little ones,
with the careworn mother who slaved from sunrise
till night for them and her rascal husband? That
child Annie who limped so pitifully, the district
physician had told him that very morning, had
tuberculosis of the hip-joint, and it was killing her
slowly. Poor child! Surely this was she at the
window. Her face looked pinched and small; yet
she must be nearly eleven.</p>

<p>Eleven! The letter dropped unopened from the
burgomaster's hand. That would have been the age
of their own little girl had she lived. His pipe went
out and grew cold; his thoughts were far away.
They were travelling slowly back over a road he had
shunned these many years, until he had almost lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the trail. His little Gertrude, their only child, a
happy, winsome elf had filled the house with sunshine
and laughter until in one brief month her life
had gone out like the flame of a candle and left
them alone! Since then they had been a lonesome
couple. Tenderly attached to each other, but both
silent, reserved people, husband and wife had locked
their grief in their own hearts and tried to live it
down.</p>

<p>Had they? He could even then see his wife at
her work in the room across the yard. As she bent
over her knitting, he noticed a little stoop which he
had not seen before; and surely her hair was turning
gray at the temples. His had long been so. They
were growing old in their childless home. With a
sudden pang there came to him a realization of the
selfishness of his grief, which had shut her out of it.
Christmas eve! What a happy time they used to
have together in the old days around the tree!
Even now he could hear the glad voices of children
from the grocer's across the street, where they were
making ready for theirs. In their house there had
not been one since&mdash;since their Gertrude left them.
There was Jens, the forester, carrying in a Christmas
tree over there even now&mdash;Jens who had
caught Black Hans. What sort of Christmas would
they keep in his hut, with the father locked up,
sure of a heavy fine, which meant a long time in jail,
since he had no money to settle with?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The childish face with the grave eyes was at the
window again, keeping its dismal watch. Eleven
years! His mind went back, swiftly this time, over
the freshly broken road to the days when the tree
was lighted in their home on Christmas eve. Of all
the nights in the year, it had been the loneliest since,
with just the two of them alone at the table, growing
old.</p>

<p>A flood of tenderness swept over the burgomaster,
and with it came a sudden resolve. It was not yet
too late. He rose and slammed the desk down hard,
leaving the rest of his mail unopened. Three
o'clock! Almost time to light the candles, and this
night he would light them himself. Yes, he would.
He tapped on the window and beckoned to Jens,
who was coming out of the grocery store. In the
vestibule they held a brief whispered consultation
that concluded with the warning, "and don't you
tell my wife." The old clerk heard it and gave a
start. What secret did the burgomaster have from
the burgomasterinde which Jens, the forester, might
share? But he remembered the day, in time, and
bestowed upon himself a knowing wink. He, too,
had his secrets.</p>

<p>Jens was less quick-witted. He offered some
objection apparently, but it was promptly overruled
by the burgomaster, who pushed him out with a
friendly but decisive nod and bade him be gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very little ones&mdash;two, mind. And don't let
her see."</p>

<p>Whereupon the burgomaster put on his overcoat
and went out, too.</p>

<p>Before the church bells rang in the holy eve, all
the gossips in town were busy with the report that
the burgomaster had been buying enough Christmas
toys and candles to stock an orphan asylum. What
had come over the man? Five dolls, counted the
toy-shop woman, with eyes that grew wide in the
telling&mdash;five! And they alone, the two of them, in
the big house with never a Christmas tree there
that any one could remember! It must be that they
were expecting company.</p>

<p>Nothing was further from the mind of the burgomasterinde
as she went along with her preparations
for the holiday. It had been a lonesome day with
her, for all she had tried to fill it with housewifely
tasks. Christmas eve always was. Now, as she sat
with her knitting, her thoughts dwelt upon the days
long gone when it had meant something to them;
when a child's laughter had thrilled her mother
heart. To her it was no unfamiliar road she was
travelling. The memory of her child, which her
husband had tried to shut out of his life lest it
unman him for his work, she had cherished in her
heart, and all life's burdens had been lightened and
sweetened by it. Her one grief was that this of all
things she could not share with him. No one ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
heard her speak Gertrude's name, but there was
sometimes a wistful look in her face which caused
the burgomaster vague alarm, and once or twice had
led to grave conferences with the family practitioner
about Mrs. Brent's health. The old doctor,
who was also the family friend, shook his head.
The burgomasterinde was a well woman; his pills
were not needed. Once he had hinted that her
loss&mdash;but the burgomaster had interrupted him
hastily. She would get over that, if indeed she had
not quite forgotten; to stir it up would do no good.
And the doctor, who was wise in other ways than
those of his books, dropped the subject.</p>

<p>The burgomasterinde had seen Black Hans
brought in in charge of Jens, and understood what
the trouble was. As he was led away to the jail,
her woman's heart yearned for his children. She
knew them well. The town gossips were right: the
path to the poacher's hut her familiar feet had
found oftener than her stern husband guessed. The
want and neglect in that wretched home stirred her
to pity; but more than that it was the little crippled
girl who drew her with the memory of her own.
She had overheard the doctor telling her husband
that there was no help for her where she was, and
all day her mind had been busy with half-formed
plans to get her away to the great seashore hospital
where such cripples were made whole, if there was
any help for them. Now, as she passed them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
review, with the picture of Black Hans behind the
bars for their background, a purpose grew up in her
mind and took shape. They should not starve and
be cold on Christmas eve, if their father <i>was</i> in jail.
She would make Christmas for them herself. And
hard upon the heels of this resolve trod a thought
that made her drop her knitting and gaze long and
musingly across the yard to the window at which
her husband sat buried in his mail.</p>

<p>The burgomaster's face was turned from her.
She could not see that he held in his hand the very
letter with the Christmas stamp that had stirred
unwonted thoughts within him; but she knew the
furrow that had grown in the years of lonely longing.
She had watched it deepen, and he had not
deceived her, but she had vainly sought a way out.
All at once she knew the way. They would keep
Christmas again as of old, the two&mdash;nay, the three
of them together. With a quick smile that had yet
in it a shadow of fright, she went about carrying out
her purpose.</p>

<p>So it befell that when Jens, the forester, was
making off for the woods where the Christmas trees
grew, shaking his head at the burgomaster's queer
commission, the voice of the burgomasterinde called
him back to the kitchen door, and he received the
second and the greater shock of the day.</p>

<p>"Get two wee ones," she wound up her directions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
"and bring them here to the back door. Don't tell
my husband, and be sure he does not see."</p>

<p>Jens stared. "But the burgomaster&mdash;" he began.
She stopped him.</p>

<p>"No matter about the burgomaster," she said
briskly. "Only don't let him know. Bring them
here as soon as it is dark."</p>

<p>And Jens departed, shaking his head in hopeless
bewilderment.</p>

<p>The early winter twilight had fallen when he
returned with two green bundles, one of which by
dint of much strategy he smuggled into the front
office without the burgomasterinde seeing him, while
he delivered the other at the back door without the
burgomaster being the wiser, this being made easier
by the fact that the latter had not yet returned from
his visit to the shops. When, a little while later he
came home, tiptoeing in like a guilty Santa Claus on
his early evening rounds, he shut himself in alone.</p>

<p>Profound quiet reigned in the official residence
for a full hour after dark. In both wings of the
house the shutters were closed tight. In one the
burgomasterinde was presumably busy with her
household duties; in the other the burgomaster was
occupied with a task that would have made the old
clerk doubt the evidence of his eyes had he himself
not been at that moment engaged in the same identical
business at his own home. Two small Christmas
trees stood upon the table, from which law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
books and legal papers had been cleared with an
unceremonious haste that had left them in an undignified
heap on the floor. The burgomaster
between them was fixing colored wax candles, cornucopias,
and paper dolls in their branches. He
eyed a bag of oranges ruefully. They were too
heavy for the little trees, but then they would do to
bank about the roots. To be sure, they had left
these behind in the woods, but the fact was not
apparent: each little tree was planted in a huge
flower-pot, as Jens had received his orders, just as
if it had grown there.</p>

<p>One brief moment the burgomaster paused in his
absurd task. It was when he had put the last
candle in place that something occurred to him
which made him stand awhile in deep thought, gazing
fixedly at the trees. Then he went to his desk,
and from a back drawer, seldom used, took out
something that shone like silver in the light. Perhaps
it was that which made him screen his eyes
with his hand when he saw it. It was a little silver
star, such as many a Christmas tree bore at its top
that night to tell the children of the Star of Bethlehem.
The burgomaster sat and looked at it while
the furrow grew deeper in his forehead; then he put
it back gently into its envelop and closed the desk.</p>

<p>It was nearly time for dinner when he straightened
up and heaved a sigh of contentment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
candles on one of the little trees were lighted, and
all was ready.</p>

<p>"If only," he said uncertainly&mdash;"if only she is
not in now." Could some good fairy have given
him second sight to pierce the walls between his
office and his wife's room, what he saw there would
certainly have made him believe he had taken leave
of his senses. Jens had just gone out with one
Christmas tree, all hung with children's toys. On
the table stood the other in its pot, a vision of
beauty. The mistress of the house sat before it with
a little box in her lap from which she took one
cherished trinket after another, last of all a silvery
angel with folded wings. A tear fell upon it as she
set it in the tree, but she wiped this away and
stood back, surveying her work with happy eyes.
It <i>was</i> beautiful.</p>

<p>"I wonder where Jonas is. I haven't heard his
step for an hour." She listened at the door. All
was quiet. "I will just carry it over and surprise
him when he comes in." And she went out into the
hall with her shining burden.</p>

<p>At that precise moment the door of the office was
opened, and the burgomaster came out, carrying his
Christmas tree. They met upon the landing. For
a full minute they stood looking at each other in
stunned silence. It was the burgomaster who
broke it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were so lonely," he said huskily, "and I
thought of our Gertrude."</p>

<p>She put down her tree, and went to him.</p>

<p>"Look, Jonas," she said, with her head on his
shoulder, and pointed where it stood. He saw
through blurring tears the child's precious belongings
from her last Christmas,&mdash;their last Christmas,&mdash;and
he bent down and kissed her.</p>

<p>"I know," he said simply; "it was Black Hans'
little Annie. See!" He drew her into his office,
"I made one for her. Jens shall take it over."</p>

<p>She hid her face on his breast. "He just went
with one from me," she sobbed, struggling between
laughter and tears; and as he started, she hugged
him close. "But we need this one. I tell you,
Jonas, what we will do: we will send it to Black
Hans in the jail."</p>

<p>And even so it came to pass. To Jens's final and
utter stupefaction, he was bidden to carry the fourth
and last of the trees to the lock-up, where it cheered
Black Hans that Christmas eve. It was noticed
both by the turnkey and by the poacher that it bore
a bright silver star at the top, but neither could
know that it was to be a star of hope indeed for
little Annie and her dark home. For so it had been
settled between the burgomaster and his wife, as
they pinned it on together and wished each other a
right Merry Christmas, with many, many more to
come, that happy night.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
